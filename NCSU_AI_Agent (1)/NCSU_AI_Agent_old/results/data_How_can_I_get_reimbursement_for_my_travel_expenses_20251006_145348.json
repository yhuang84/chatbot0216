If applicants are all awarded the maximum amount ($1,500), we will minimum 6 awards.\n* In the spring, the GSA allocates $7,500 for the GSA Award for Conferences. If applicants are all awarded the maximum amount ($1,500), we will minimum 5 awards.\n\n---\n\n## **GSA Travel Assistance Award**\n\n*How many GSA Travel Assistance Awards are awarded each semester?*\n\n* Currently, over 20 GSA Travel Assistance Awards worth $500 each are available per semester. However, this does not guarantee that you will receive the award as they are merit-based, just as the GSA Award for Conferences are.\n\n*Are there any other Travel Awards that I can apply for?*\n\n* Based on the availability, through the applications of GSA Award for Conferences or GSA Travel Assistance award, committee can recommend that you receive either Arthur B. Moss International Grant or Bob & Seuster Sowell Travel Fellowship.\n\n### ***Eligibility***\n\n*I want to apply, but have not received notification on my abstract acceptance, can I still apply?*\n\n* You may still apply if you have not received notification on your abstract status by the application deadline. Notify the VP of Academic Affairs as soon as you receive notice. However, if you win the award, we require that you send us the confirmation within two weeks of the notification of winning the award. You will not receive reimbursement until we have the abstract confirmation.\n\n*Are teaching assistant students or online students eligible to apply?*\n\n* Yes, all fee-paying graduate students in good academic standing (GPA > 3.0) can apply.\n\n### ***Reimbursement***\n\n*Do I need to submit a Travel Authorization (TA)?*\n\n* Yes, our reimbursement process follows NC State policy. NC State provides a guide on how to submit a Travel Authorization.\n\n*How will awardees receive funds?*\n\n* The GSA awards operate on a reimbursement basis. This means the applicant must pay for the conference and then be reimbursed after travel occurs. Reimbursement is handled by the GSA Treasurer, and receipts for conference registration, air travel, and hotel are required.\n\n*Does my department receive the funds?*\n\n* The award is reimbursed to the person who paid (and has receipts) for the conference. If a student paid out-of-pocket, then they will receive the reimbursement. If the department covered expenses, then the department will fill out the reimbursement form and receive the funds.\n\n*What expenses are covered?*\n\n* The travel awards cover expenses directly related to your conference, such as conference registration, hotel, airfare, and food. The travel awards do not cover personal expenses such as entertainment or travel which is not directly related to the conference.\n\n*Can I be reimbursed for a reservation through AirBnB?*\n\n* We follow NC State’s policy on AirBnB, and we typically cannot reimburse for this type of lodging arrangement unless it is pre-approved by the university. We would need this same documentation required by the university (approved) submitted to us in order to reimburse.\n\n*How does reimbursement work if I drive to a conference?*\n\n* On the application, you will input your mileage based on the number of miles driven per day. NC State recently updated their mileage reimbursement process (See Travel Mileage Rage Change Memo) so that for the first 100 miles, you will receive $0.535 per mile with any additional miles over 100 reimbursed at $0.17 per day. There are two sections, one, if you travel less than 100 miles per day and an additional section if you travel more than 100 miles per day. To calculate how much you will be reimbursed, you would enter up to 100 miles per day (indicated by “Include 0-100 miles (per day!)”) in the first entry and everything else in the second entry (indicated by “Include 101+ miles (per day!)”). This means that the first entry can exceed 100 miles (in increments of 100). For example, if you drive to a conference that is 150 miles away, you would input 200 miles in the first entry (100 miles there and 100 miles back) and then 100 miles in the second entry (50 miles there and 50 miles back). This would amount to (200 x $0.535) + (100 x $0.17) = $124.\n\n*Can the travel awards be used to support travel expenses for multiple conferences?*\n\n* Unfortunately, an award can only be used for one conference that is specified at the time of applying. It is non-transferable whether it be to another person or to another conference.\n\n### ***Personal Statement***\n\n*Where can I find the personal statement prompts?*\n\n* The prompts are provided within the application in the personal statement section.\n\n*Does the character count include space?*\n\n* Yes.\n\n### ***Letters of Recommendation and DGP Authorization***\n\n*Where do we submit the letter of recommendation?*\n\n* Letters of recommendation must be submitted by the reference writer. The link is publicly available, and the applicant should review it prior to emailing it to their reference writer. Please remember that submitting or saving the information of reference writers on the application would not automatically send them an email with the link. It is applicant’s responsibility to email them the link.\n\n*Where do we submit the DGP Authorization?*\n\n* DGP Authorizations must be submitted by the DGP. The link is publicly available, and the applicant should review it prior to emailing it to their DGP. Please remember that submitting or saving the information of DGP on the application would not automatically send them an email with the link. It is applicant’s responsibility to email them the link.\n\n*Who can write reference letters?*\n\n* Anyone you feel can provide a better representation of who you are outside of your research.\n\n*Will I receive notification when my letters of recommendation and DGP authorization are submitted?*\n\n* Yes. If you have not received notification that these materials are submitted, you should follow up with your reference writer or DGP to make sure that these are submitted before the deadline. Sometimes reference writer or DGP do not enter correct applicant email on their forms. Please make sure to send them correct information. They will not be accepted after the deadline.\n\n*Is there a limit to how many applications can be submitted by a program?*\n\n* No. However, the GSA reserves the right to limit the number of applications to no more than 5% of the total number of graduate students in the same program based on volume of applications received. In this instance, the DGP will assist in narrowing down the pool of applicants from their respective program based on the highest quality of research. This would happen after all applications have been submitted and evaluated and aids in the selection process.\n\n---\n\n## **Applying to Both Awards**\n\n*Can I apply to both awards?*\n\n* Yes. Since there is only one application form for both awards, indicating that you are applying to ‘both’ on one application will be sufficient.\n* If awarded, you can only receive one award per application cycle, determined by the selection committee. A graduate student can receive one award per academic year (Ex. If you receive either award in the Fall 2017, you cannot receive an award in the Spring 2018 OR if you receive either award in the Spring 2017, you cannot receive an award in the Fall 2017). Additionally, you can only receive each award once per graduate degree.\n\n*Can I receive both awards?*\n\n* Yes. However, a graduate student can receive one award per academic year (Ex. If you receive either award in the Fall, you cannot receive an award in the Spring OR if you receive either award in the Spring, you cannot receive an award in the Fall). Additionally, you can only receive each award once per graduate degree.\n\n*I decided after my DGP authorization and letters of recommendation were submitted for one award that I am going to apply to both?

      "content": "Creating a Travel Reimbursement for Non-Employee\n\n Contact:\n\n Humanities and Social Sciences\n Financial Services\n\n Last Revision Date:\n\n 8/22/23\n\n Introduction:\n\n This section provides step by step instructions on processing a travel reimbursement within the\n Travel Center for a Non-Employee as excerpted from the NCSU Travel Center User’s Guide.\n Pre-authorization for Non-Employee travel is required and must be agreed to in advance\n by the traveler and the department head/designee as to services to be provided by the\n traveler and the travel expense commitment made by the department.   Students and\n non-resident aliens  must  use form  AP-104  (Non-Employee  Travel Authorization) for travel\n authorization purposes.  Pre-authorization for all others can be accomplished by a personal\n service contract, email or letter of invitation outlining the service and commitment, and/or by\n using form AP-104.  Non-Employees are subject to the same travel policies as are university\n employees, including statutory subsistence allowances.  The college of Humanities and Social\n Sciences requires travelers to submit their travel expenses for reimbursement no more than 30\n days after the travel end date.  Late justifications should be written by the Department Head, and\n should include preventative measures if travel is more than 30 days late.  NC General Statute\n 138-6(c) requires that all reimbursement requests must be filed for approval within 30 days after\n the travel period for which reimbursement is being requested.\n\n All post travel reimbursement requests are processed through The Travel Center.\n\n Steps – Create a Travel Reimbursement without an Approved Travel Authorization for a\n Non-Employee:\n\n 1.\n\n Log in to  MyPack  portal at  https://mypack.ncsu.edu/  .\n\n 2.\n\n Go to  For Faculty & Staff →  under the  Employee Self  Service  section,  click\n\n .\n\n 3.\n\n Go to New Reimbursements.\n\n 1\n\n\f 5.\n\n Enter the Supplier  ID  for the non-employee.  If you  do not have a supplier ID  Add Supplier\n in  Supplier Center  or  see section of Travel Manual  on Adding a Supplier  .\n\n 6.\n\n Select the  Reimbursement Type  that applies from the  drop-down listing: Individual, Mileage\n Only, or Team/Group.\n\n 7.\n\n Enter the  Begin Date  of the travel.\n\n 8.\n\n Click  Add  .\n\n 9.\n\n The system will direct you to the reimbursement entry page.\n\n 10.  Complete and/or review the following fields:\n\n (cid:0)  Supervisor ID  – The supervisor listed on the reimbursement  will be supervisor of\n the person that entered the reimbursement.  The approval supervisor can be changed\n to fit business needs. To designate another supervisor, enter the Supervisor’s user ID\n in the Supervisor ID field. If you do not know the supervisor’s user ID, use the\n icon to locate the ID.\n\n 2\n\n\f o   Employee, Student, and US Citizen status will be visible. Please note: Foreign\n\n National visitors should have already been cleared for payment via the\n authorization process.  If not, STOP here and  reference  section on Travel\n Authorization_Non-Employees  of the Travel Manual.\n\n o   Verify the traveler’s address. Use the\n\n icon to look  up additional addresses and\n\n make changes if necessary.\n\n o   The system will display the last four digits of the traveler’s banking information.\n If listed, this is an indicator that the traveler will receive a direct deposit of their\n reimbursement. If it is not listed, the payment will be made via check.\n\n o   If there is a  business need  to process a manual check  for pick-up, check the box\n\n next to  Hold Check for Pickup in the Controller’s  Office  and designate a person to\n pick-up the check within the  Comments field  under  Basic Travel Details  .

Important: The  College requires travelers to\n submit their travel expenses for reimbursement no more than 30 days after the travel\n end date  .  Travel submitted beyond the 30-day college  requirement, requires a late\n memo written by the Department Head.  The memo should include preventative\n measures to avoid reoccurrence and must be uploaded to the TR for Campus\n Approval.\n If the travel reimbursement is submitted more than 60 days past the travel end date,\n the initiator will receive the following system message:\n\n 3\n\n\f After clicking the “OK” button, the Late Entry Justification comment box will\n automatically appear and the traveler is required to document why the travel\n reimbursement is being submitted late.   Completion of this field is required in order\n to submit the travel reimbursement for routing.\n\n •\n\n •\n\n •\n\n Enter  Begin Time  and  End Time  (include travel time  to and from duty station/home,\n less personal stops)\n\n Currency Converter link to access the Oanda  currency conversion\n\n Use the\n website.

Research, are for students who plan to attend a research conference and need additional financial assistance with travel to present their work. They are distributed to a student’s mentor or home department who must match the amount and then award funds through a travel reimbursement. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year, including summer.\n\n![SCUBA diver underwater making the sign of the wolfpack with their hand](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/10/2021-NC-Scuba-Dive-M-Beeson-cropped-edited.jpg)\n\n## Funding\n\n* Applicants may request up to $200 to partially cover their travel/conference-related expenses.\n  + Amount must be matched by student’s mentor or home department.\n  + Funds are disbursed to student’s mentors or home departments to then be awarded as reimbursements after travel and requirements are fulfilled. *Please note: this means that the student’s home department will be responsible for creating the Travel Authorization and the Travel Reimbursement.

Students and Faculty****should not****be placing orders outside of Marketplace.**\n\nPlease use the [MAE Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa) for all non-Marketplace purchase requests within the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. For all Facility Work Order Requests please use [MAE Facility Work Order Request Form.](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/eb5055ffd6a24044bef697c44e9403c8)\n\n[Click here if you don’t know what information you need to provide with a purchase request.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6CSp6QfGqYZ5SxIAqlPBi1a0IAD6BTD/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThese forms will be routed to your supervisor and the appropriate contract manager and/or Business Officer/ Department Head for approvals. You will receive an approval confirmation email when the request is fully approved. This will be the PO you will provide to vendors.\n\n* [Senior Design Personal Reimbursement Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5f1e9a01922a433dae3669b363a6a4bb)\n  + This form is only to be used by AE or ME senior design students requesting reimbursement.\n* [Faculty Start Up Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa)\n  + This form should be used to request faculty start-up funds.\n* [Personal Reimbursement](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5f11a2314182454e8dae06c93ac97ec2)\n  + You can either create a new Reimbursement Form or generate one from an existing Purchase Request.\n* **IT Purchases**\n  + For IT Purchase Requests submit the [IT Purchase Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDtZ60R_-xOIJ0vE0C2Xh66iZ61OpZ_bV0qekutMfW0UgcUQ/viewform?usp=dialog). This form is meant for faculty and staff to order IT equipment and should not be used for other purchase requests.\n  + Visit the [IT page](https://mae.ncsu.edu/mymae/information-technologyit/) for more details.\n\n### Purchasing Process- Purchases under 5K\n\n1. Discuss purchases with your supervisor.\n2. Enter the purchase request into the [MAE Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa). You will receive an email that confirms your order has been submitted correctly.\n3. Request is routed to PI for approval.\n4. Request is routed to Funding manager for approval.\n5. You will receive an email when your request is fully approved.\n6. A purchaser will process the order within 24-48 hours of approval, depending on workload.\n7. You will receive the order confirmation and shipping details as soon as they are received from the vendor.\n8. You will receive an email when your package is delivered.\n9. When you pick up your package, check the contents to make sure they are correct and not damaged.\n\n### Purchasing Process- Purchases over 5K\n\n* Orders over $5000 cannot be placed by departmental purchasing and cannot be placed using a departmental purchasing card. They must be placed by the university’s purchasing team.\n* You will submit your request the same as orders under $5000, except you must include a sole source justification.\n* Create and attach a sole source justification explaining why the item you are buying must come from this vendor.\n  + The sole source justification must be on departmental letterhead and must be signed.\n  + In order to meet state of North Carolina requirements a sole source justification needs to:\n    - Give a brief description of the item and its function\n    - Provide an explanation why the product or service requested is the only product or service that can satisfy your requirements and why alternatives are unacceptable.\n\n* If a sole source justification is not provided, university purchasing will submit the order for bidding. This gives other companies an opportunity to offer a better deal on the same order. The order is posted for bids for 10 days. At the end of the 10 day bidding period, university purchasing will send you the best offer so you can verify all is correct and approve the order.\n* Orders over $5000 take longer to process than orders under $5000. The MAE purchasing team member will submit the order to university purchasing within 24-48 hours of when the order is fully approved. University purchasing processes orders in the order they are received (It usually takes 3-4 weeks for procurement to issue a PO).\n* If a sole source justification is provided- it can take around 3-4 weeks from the date submitted for the university purchasing team to process the order with the vendor.\n* If a sole source justification is not provided- It can take around a week from the date submitted for the university purchasing team to submit the order for bidding. Then the 10 days for bids. After the bids close they will contact you for our approval to proceed with the best offer. Then they can create and send the PO to the vendor. It can take 4-5 weeks to complete this process.\n\n### Important Reminders\n\n* Verify email addresses\n* Verify project number\n* Do not underestimate or leave shipping cost blank\n* Make sure you have set the sharing settings to allow anyone with the link to access documents. If we have to request access to your document/spreadsheet this can delay processing.\n* Backorders, Preorders and Lead times:\n  + Look out for out-of-stock items, backordered items, or items with an extended lead time. If the purchasing team goes to place an order and notices one of these they will put the entire order on hold and contact the requester for further instructions. This can delay processing. Note if you are aware of and approve backordered items in the Comment section so we can proceed. If you know the order has an extended lead time, write that in the comments so we know you are aware of the wait.\n* Product options\n  + If there are options for items (color, length, voltage, etc.) be sure to include this in your order request. If it is not provided, we will contact you to confirm. This can delay processing.\n\n### Who to buy from\n\n* MarketPlace:\n  + Why purchase from a Marketplace vendor?\n    - Vendors offer us educational discounts\n    - Most vendors offer us Free shipping\n    - Easier and more lenient returns\n    - [MarketPlace Vendor List](https://materialsmgmt.ofa.ncsu.edu/purchasing/marketplace/)\n* Non-MarketPlace:\n  + We Highly recommend you not use an international vendor, unless absolutely necessary.\n    - There are hidden costs that you may not see (customs and duty taxes).\n    - Shipping is generally slower\n    - Returns are difficult\n    - Less recourse if items arrive damaged or not as described\n    - Take longer to process, especially if the vendor does not have an online ordering system. Time differences, language barriers, payment options, and different international holidays can all delay processing.\n  + If the vendor cannot accept credit cards, and has not done business with NC State before, we will have to add them to the university’s supplier center via payment works before we can place an order with them. Depending on how fast the vendor completes the online registration it can take some time to get them approved as a new vendor\n* NC State has debarred (banned) vendors which we are not allowed to order from [debarred vendor](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/ece-administration/finance/purchasing/helpful-links).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n* What if I want to use a service provided by NC State? For example, Surplus\n  + An order request must be submitted. Once approved, we will provide you with information to give to them.\n* What if I need to add another item(s) to an order that has already been submitted to MAE Purchasing?\n  + It is best to submit a new order request.\n* What if I need to cancel my order?\n  + Please email MAE-purchasing@ncsu.edu asking the order to be canceled.\n* What if packages are expected to be delivered over the weekend or on a holiday?\n  + No deliveries will occur at the University because we are closed. Deliveries will occur the next business day.\n* Can items be shipped to my home?\n  + No, it is against University Policy.\n* Can I pick up an item that was delivered to Main Campus Mailroom due to USPS?\n  + No. The University Main Campus Mailroom receives a large volume of mail/shipments daily.\n* What are packing slips?\n  + A packing slip is a document included in a package that lists the contents of the package.\n* Where can I pick up my shipment?\n  + Most shipments are delivered to EB3 Room 3002, if it is too large to be delivered to room 3002, the front desk person will assist you in locating your shipment. Large shipments for MAE West will be shipped to 3240 Ligon Street.\n\n### Travel Processes: Employee Travel\n\n**Travel Authorizations Must Be Approved 30 days Before the Travel Occurs.**\n\n**Travel Reimbursements Must Be Filed no later than 30 days After the return date from travel.**\n\n*Any travel reimbursement filed 90 past the return date are subject to not being reimbursed (any travel reimbursement filed over 30 days past return date MUST have Department Head signature, as well as an explanation for the late filing).*\n\n#### Travel Checklist\n\n1. Go to the Travel Center in your MyPack Portal and create a Travel Authorization. It is suggested you do this at least 30 days ahead of time so that it has time to be fully approved before your travel. Your supervisor and the funding manager will need to approve the authorization request.\n2. Once your TA (Travel Authorization) has been approved you can make purchases for that trip (flight, hotel bookings, rental car, etc.).\n3. Note: Once your TA is approved you have the option to seek the assistance of an MAE Purchaser to help you with your conference registration. Flights and hotels cannot be purchased by the purchasing team, those will need to purchased by the traveler and filed for reimbursement through the travel reimbursement system.\n   1. MAE can only pay conference registration in advance (via an order request – BUT you must include the TA with the request)  MAE will NOT pay in advance for flight or hotel (these will be reimbursed through travel reimbursement).\n4. Make sure you keep a copy of all receipts for all purchases, except meals.\n   1. Meals are reimbursed on a per diem basis. This means you get a set amount of money reimbursed to you for each meal, regardless of what you actually spent on meals. You do not need to keep meal receipts. You will only be reimbursed for meals not covered by the conference/meeting. If a meal is covered by the conference/meeting it should be excluded from your reimbursement.\n   2. Meals are only allowed when in overnight travel status. They are calculated on travel begin and end time on a per diem basis, so make sure your entered dates are accurate. There are different rates for In-State, Out of State, and Out-of-Country Travel.\n5. Once you return from Travel, go to the Travel Center in your MyPack Portal and create a Travel Reimbursement.\n   1. You will need to scan and upload your receipts to the Reimbursement, except meals. Your supervisor and the funding manager will need to approve the reimbursement request.\n6. Once your TR is fully approved, you will be reimbursed via Direct Deposit.\n\n### Travel Tips\n\n* **Travel Authorizations**\n  + Must be submitted in the Travel Portal or by AP104 at least 30 days in advance of travel. The amounts, unless known at the time before your trip, are estimated such as taxi rides and meals.\n* **Conference Travel**\n  + Always upload an agenda. If meals are included in the registration fee you need to exclude these on your meal calculation section.\n* **Hotel Receipts**\n  + A booking confirmation is not a receipt. A Folio is required from the Hotel which itemizes charges and shows proof of payment.\n  + If sharing rooms with another traveler and you are splitting expenses, have the hotel issue separate Folios. If one traveler pays for both parties, the entire amount will be reimbursed to the payee. Do not have your other party pay you for their half. This complicates the reimbursement process.\n  + Remove any room service or hotel restaurant charges from the lodging total.\n* **3rd party / non-commercial lodging**\n  + An example is Airbnb. This requires pre-approval before departing on your trip. Whoever will pay for the airbnb will need to submit the Third Party Housing request following the instructions in the Travel Authorization page (the Information button beside of the Third Party Lodging check box). Each traveler will need to check the third party housing link and reference each other TA’s in the comments section so they are appropriately linked.\n  + To obtain approval to utilize 3rd party / non-commercial lodging, submit a request for approval prior to incurring expenses or traveling by completing the [Pre-Approval for 3rd Party / Non-Commercial Lodging Usage and Expenses Form](https://controller.ofa.ncsu.edu/pre-approval-for-3rd-party-non-commercial-lodging/). Upon clicking submit, the form is forwarded electronically to the University Controller’s Office for review. The review will begin once the fully completed form with all required documentation is received. Incomplete forms and missing documentation will delay the start of the review. Once the review is complete, the University Controller’s Office will email the outcome to the contact indicated on the pre-approval form. Please allow at least 7 business days for processing within the University Controller’s Office.\n* **Airline Receipts**\n  + Boarding passes are not necessary. Include the flight agenda and proof of purchase. If a flight was changed resulting in an e-credit, include the original flight receipt and the adjusted one.\n* **Personal Travel**\n  + For example, when you have finished a conference and want to take personal time before returning home. Note personal travel days in the notes section and include the actual return flight departure day in your travel end time. You will need to exclude meals during your personal days.\n  + Attach 3 flight comparisons of flights leaving after the conference ended. This can be uploaded to the Travel Authorization before your trip. If it is after the trip, attach 3 comparisons of a future date with the departure day being the day after the conference.\n* **Original Receipts**\n  + Original receipts are required for taxi, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. A credit card transaction detail is not acceptable.\n* **Meals**\n  + Meals are only allowed when in overnight travel status. They are calculated on travel begin and end time on a per diem basis, so make sure your entered dates are accurate. There are different rates for In-State, Out of State, and Out-of-Country Travel.\n  + Do not send receipts for meals purchased.\n\n### Travel Processes: Non-Employee Travel\n\n* [MAE Non-Employee Travel Authorization Form](https://click.smartsheet.com/f/app/C62s4ActLUS1GgXRyaoL_A~~/AARF7xA~/IV6YX1XuQaIN2935uXaLbiJz1hNZ4BS3l7ilkBfw9OGfq73XOoRSa5Z4Q4VSidlA_6da1JH-OeMpKsF338_NqUn-hEf5dwfG1hW-LBrTNs8CrI_ZoWP6sTIzIV-A91TscCxcerjuxsE5PJYKxacX2dIYQlT-qEJ77CZPWJYNr_U~)\n* [MAE Non-Employee Travel Reimbursement Form](https://click.smartsheet.com/f/app/3uV4h0B45bz4D6RPoZy38w~~/AARF7xA~/OIzB4HxE-2JDrPpWr1Unm9GpiV-okxa3BWLuLB_y8LJMsrw6wXQUP9wipRYBB-H52w6VlIZLAe-WZ9RrmcC_EOwz1cL9VR6QJX87p8jMBtx_2w0O07v9TJN7TVvMkB3rhfSnpXutZqSvFYGIi48609oJEJfJevxQbvF8z26rsXY~)\n* [Travel Receipts](https://mae.ncsu.edu/mymae/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/08/travel-receipts.pdf)\n\n**Travel Authorizations Must Be Approved 30 days Before the Travel Occurs.**\n\n**Travel Reimbursements Must Be Filed no later than 30 days After the return date from travel.**\n\n*Any travel reimbursement filed 90 past the return date are subject to not being reimbursed (any travel reimbursement filed over 30 days past return date MUST have Department Head signature, as well as an explanation for the late filing).*\n\n#### Travel Checklist\n\n1.

This means you get a set amount of money reimbursed to you for each meal, regardless of what you actually spent on meals. You do not need to keep meal receipts. You will only be reimbursed for meals not covered by the conference/meeting. If a meal is covered by the conference/meeting it should be excluded from your reimbursement.\n   * Meals are only allowed when in overnight travel status. They are calculated on travel begin and end time on a per diem basis, so make sure your entered dates are accurate. There are different rates for In-State, Out of State and Out-of-Country Travel.\n4. Once you return from Travel, submit the above the MAE Non-employee Travel Reimbursement form.\n   * You will need to scan and upload your receipts to the Reimbursement, except meals.

If applicants are all awarded the maximum amount ($1,500), we will minimum 6 awards.\n* In the spring, the GSA allocates $7,500 for the GSA Award for Conferences. If applicants are all awarded the maximum amount ($1,500), we will minimum 5 awards.\n\n---\n\n## **GSA Travel Assistance Award**\n\n*How many GSA Travel Assistance Awards are awarded each semester?*\n\n* Currently, over 20 GSA Travel Assistance Awards worth $500 each are available per semester. However, this does not guarantee that you will receive the award as they are merit-based, just as the GSA Award for Conferences are.\n\n*Are there any other Travel Awards that I can apply for?*\n\n* Based on the availability, through the applications of GSA Award for Conferences or GSA Travel Assistance award, committee can recommend that you receive either Arthur B. Moss International Grant or Bob & Seuster Sowell Travel Fellowship.\n\n### ***Eligibility***\n\n*I want to apply, but have not received notification on my abstract acceptance, can I still apply?*\n\n* You may still apply if you have not received notification on your abstract status by the application deadline. Notify the VP of Academic Affairs as soon as you receive notice. However, if you win the award, we require that you send us the confirmation within two weeks of the notification of winning the award. You will not receive reimbursement until we have the abstract confirmation.\n\n*Are teaching assistant students or online students eligible to apply?*\n\n* Yes, all fee-paying graduate students in good academic standing (GPA > 3.0) can apply.\n\n### ***Reimbursement***\n\n*Do I need to submit a Travel Authorization (TA)?*\n\n* Yes, our reimbursement process follows NC State policy. NC State provides a guide on how to submit a Travel Authorization.\n\n*How will awardees receive funds?*\n\n* The GSA awards operate on a reimbursement basis. This means the applicant must pay for the conference and then be reimbursed after travel occurs. Reimbursement is handled by the GSA Treasurer, and receipts for conference registration, air travel, and hotel are required.\n\n*Does my department receive the funds?*\n\n* The award is reimbursed to the person who paid (and has receipts) for the conference. If a student paid out-of-pocket, then they will receive the reimbursement. If the department covered expenses, then the department will fill out the reimbursement form and receive the funds.\n\n*What expenses are covered?*\n\n* The travel awards cover expenses directly related to your conference, such as conference registration, hotel, airfare, and food. The travel awards do not cover personal expenses such as entertainment or travel which is not directly related to the conference.\n\n*Can I be reimbursed for a reservation through AirBnB?*\n\n* We follow NC State’s policy on AirBnB, and we typically cannot reimburse for this type of lodging arrangement unless it is pre-approved by the university. We would need this same documentation required by the university (approved) submitted to us in order to reimburse.\n\n*How does reimbursement work if I drive to a conference?*\n\n* On the application, you will input your mileage based on the number of miles driven per day. NC State recently updated their mileage reimbursement process (See Travel Mileage Rage Change Memo) so that for the first 100 miles, you will receive $0.535 per mile with any additional miles over 100 reimbursed at $0.17 per day. There are two sections, one, if you travel less than 100 miles per day and an additional section if you travel more than 100 miles per day. To calculate how much you will be reimbursed, you would enter up to 100 miles per day (indicated by “Include 0-100 miles (per day!)”) in the first entry and everything else in the second entry (indicated by “Include 101+ miles (per day!)”). This means that the first entry can exceed 100 miles (in increments of 100). For example, if you drive to a conference that is 150 miles away, you would input 200 miles in the first entry (100 miles there and 100 miles back) and then 100 miles in the second entry (50 miles there and 50 miles back). This would amount to (200 x $0.535) + (100 x $0.17) = $124.\n\n*Can the travel awards be used to support travel expenses for multiple conferences?*\n\n* Unfortunately, an award can only be used for one conference that is specified at the time of applying. It is non-transferable whether it be to another person or to another conference.\n\n### ***Personal Statement***\n\n*Where can I find the personal statement prompts?*\n\n* The prompts are provided within the application in the personal statement section.\n\n*Does the character count include space?*\n\n* Yes.\n\n### ***Letters of Recommendation and DGP Authorization***\n\n*Where do we submit the letter of recommendation?*\n\n* Letters of recommendation must be submitted by the reference writer. The link is publicly available, and the applicant should review it prior to emailing it to their reference writer. Please remember that submitting or saving the information of reference writers on the application would not automatically send them an email with the link. It is applicant’s responsibility to email them the link.\n\n*Where do we submit the DGP Authorization?*\n\n* DGP Authorizations must be submitted by the DGP. The link is publicly available, and the applicant should review it prior to emailing it to their DGP. Please remember that submitting or saving the information of DGP on the application would not automatically send them an email with the link. It is applicant’s responsibility to email them the link.\n\n*Who can write reference letters?*\n\n* Anyone you feel can provide a better representation of who you are outside of your research.\n\n*Will I receive notification when my letters of recommendation and DGP authorization are submitted?*\n\n* Yes. If you have not received notification that these materials are submitted, you should follow up with your reference writer or DGP to make sure that these are submitted before the deadline. Sometimes reference writer or DGP do not enter correct applicant email on their forms. Please make sure to send them correct information. They will not be accepted after the deadline.\n\n*Is there a limit to how many applications can be submitted by a program?*\n\n* No. However, the GSA reserves the right to limit the number of applications to no more than 5% of the total number of graduate students in the same program based on volume of applications received. In this instance, the DGP will assist in narrowing down the pool of applicants from their respective program based on the highest quality of research. This would happen after all applications have been submitted and evaluated and aids in the selection process.\n\n---\n\n## **Applying to Both Awards**\n\n*Can I apply to both awards?*\n\n* Yes. Since there is only one application form for both awards, indicating that you are applying to ‘both’ on one application will be sufficient.\n* If awarded, you can only receive one award per application cycle, determined by the selection committee. A graduate student can receive one award per academic year (Ex. If you receive either award in the Fall 2017, you cannot receive an award in the Spring 2018 OR if you receive either award in the Spring 2017, you cannot receive an award in the Fall 2017). Additionally, you can only receive each award once per graduate degree.\n\n*Can I receive both awards?*\n\n* Yes. However, a graduate student can receive one award per academic year (Ex. If you receive either award in the Fall, you cannot receive an award in the Spring OR if you receive either award in the Spring, you cannot receive an award in the Fall). Additionally, you can only receive each award once per graduate degree.\n\n*I decided after my DGP authorization and letters of recommendation were submitted for one award that I am going to apply to both? Is this okay?*\n\n* Yes, the applicant needs to update this information on their applications. The DGP and reference writers do not need to submit again.\n\n*If I am applying to both awards, what do my letters of recommendation and DGP Authorization indicate on their form?*\n\n* They will indicate that you are applying to both. This provides evidence that you have notified your reference writers and your DGP that you are applying to both possible funding sources.\n\n*If I am applying to both awards, do I need additional letters of recommendation?*\n\n* No. The application form only requires two letters of recommendations.\n\n---\n\n## **General Questions**\n\n*What are the fall and spring timelines for the applications?*\n\n* The travel dates for future award cycles are changed to traveling within a six-month period after the application deadline as stated below.\n* Fall award cycle\n  + Application Available: July 15\n  + Application Deadline: September 15 at 12:59pm\n  + Travel Dates Covered: August 1 – March 30\n  + Notification Date: November 15\n* Spring award cycle\n  + Application Available: December 15\n  + Application Deadline: February 15 at 12:59pm\n  + Travel Dates Covered: February 1 – September 30\n  + Notification Date: April 15\n\n*What if I have multiple presentations at a conference?*\n\n* You would choose the abstract you deem best represents your research. Additionally, you would indicate that you are doing multiple presentations by clicking “Other” under Presentation Type followed by explaining your situation.\n\n*If we are presenting at a conference as group, can we apply as a group?*\n\n* You would apply individually.\n\n*What happens if I have the application open after the deadline and submit final edits?*\n\n* Any edits that are made on the application are timestamped. If you have access and modify your application after the deadline, it will be disqualified.\n\n*How often are the applications updated?*\n\n* Applications are evaluated and revised after each application cycle. This ensures that there are no unfair questions and also allows us to continuously make sure we are meeting the needs of the students.\n\n*Who will judge my application?*\n\n* Applications are judged by a committee made up of graduate students from the GSA. Each application is reviewed by at least 3 committee members from different departments than the applicant. Award decisions are then made by the committee during scheduled meetings.\n\n*How often are the rubrics updated?*\n\n* Rubrics are evaluated and revised after each application cycle. This ensures that there are no biases as well as allows us to continuously make sure we are meeting the needs of the students.\n\n*What are the selection criteria?*\n\n* Each application is judged according to a rubric designed by the selection committee. The rubric takes all application information into account including applicant GPA, recommendation letters and conference scope. Applicants should take extra care with the personal statement, making sure to answer all questions according to given directions and concisely and clearly.\n\n*What happens if I (accidentally) submit multiple applications?*\n\n* We strongly encourage you to keep the current edit link and make sure you fill the form as much as you can before submitting. Only the most recent submission will be reviewed.\n\n[Graduate Student Association\nHome](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa)\n\n## Campus Map\n\n[![nc state university map](https://cdn.ncsu.edu/brand-assets/campus-map/campus-map-300x160.jpg)](https://maps.ncsu.edu/#/buildings/102)\n\n* [About GSA](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/about/)\n* [Funding Opportunities](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/funding-opportunities/)\n* [Student Resources](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/student-resources/)\n* [GSA News](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/category/news/)\n* [Get Involved](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/get-involved/)\n* [Archive](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/student-resources/archive/)\n\n## Connect With Us\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NCSU.GSA)\n* [X](https://www.twitter.com/NCSU_GSA)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ncsu_gsa)\n\n© 2025 NC State University.

      "content": "Creating a Travel Reimbursement for Non-Employee\n\n Contact:\n\n Humanities and Social Sciences\n Financial Services\n\n Last Revision Date:\n\n 8/22/23\n\n Introduction:\n\n This section provides step by step instructions on processing a travel reimbursement within the\n Travel Center for a Non-Employee as excerpted from the NCSU Travel Center User’s Guide.\n Pre-authorization for Non-Employee travel is required and must be agreed to in advance\n by the traveler and the department head/designee as to services to be provided by the\n traveler and the travel expense commitment made by the department.   Students and\n non-resident aliens  must  use form  AP-104  (Non-Employee  Travel Authorization) for travel\n authorization purposes.  Pre-authorization for all others can be accomplished by a personal\n service contract, email or letter of invitation outlining the service and commitment, and/or by\n using form AP-104.  Non-Employees are subject to the same travel policies as are university\n employees, including statutory subsistence allowances.  The college of Humanities and Social\n Sciences requires travelers to submit their travel expenses for reimbursement no more than 30\n days after the travel end date.  Late justifications should be written by the Department Head, and\n should include preventative measures if travel is more than 30 days late.  NC General Statute\n 138-6(c) requires that all reimbursement requests must be filed for approval within 30 days after\n the travel period for which reimbursement is being requested.\n\n All post travel reimbursement requests are processed through The Travel Center.\n\n Steps – Create a Travel Reimbursement without an Approved Travel Authorization for a\n Non-Employee:\n\n 1.\n\n Log in to  MyPack  portal at  https://mypack.ncsu.edu/  .\n\n 2.\n\n Go to  For Faculty & Staff →  under the  Employee Self  Service  section,  click\n\n .\n\n 3.\n\n Go to New Reimbursements.\n\n 1\n\n\f 5.\n\n Enter the Supplier  ID  for the non-employee.  If you  do not have a supplier ID  Add Supplier\n in  Supplier Center  or  see section of Travel Manual  on Adding a Supplier  .\n\n 6.\n\n Select the  Reimbursement Type  that applies from the  drop-down listing: Individual, Mileage\n Only, or Team/Group.\n\n 7.\n\n Enter the  Begin Date  of the travel.\n\n 8.\n\n Click  Add  .\n\n 9.\n\n The system will direct you to the reimbursement entry page.\n\n 10.  Complete and/or review the following fields:\n\n (cid:0)  Supervisor ID  – The supervisor listed on the reimbursement  will be supervisor of\n the person that entered the reimbursement.  The approval supervisor can be changed\n to fit business needs. To designate another supervisor, enter the Supervisor’s user ID\n in the Supervisor ID field. If you do not know the supervisor’s user ID, use the\n icon to locate the ID.\n\n 2\n\n\f o   Employee, Student, and US Citizen status will be visible. Please note: Foreign\n\n National visitors should have already been cleared for payment via the\n authorization process.  If not, STOP here and  reference  section on Travel\n Authorization_Non-Employees  of the Travel Manual.\n\n o   Verify the traveler’s address. Use the\n\n icon to look  up additional addresses and\n\n make changes if necessary.\n\n o   The system will display the last four digits of the traveler’s banking information.\n If listed, this is an indicator that the traveler will receive a direct deposit of their\n reimbursement. If it is not listed, the payment will be made via check.\n\n o   If there is a  business need  to process a manual check  for pick-up, check the box\n\n next to  Hold Check for Pickup in the Controller’s  Office  and designate a person to\n pick-up the check within the  Comments field  under  Basic Travel Details  . The\n Controller’s Office will call that individual when the check is available for\n pickup.\n\n (cid:0)  The\n Reimbursement that can be displayed once the Reimbursement is saved.\n\n Travel Summary link provides a printable summary  of the Travel\n\n 11.  Under Section 1 –  Basic Travel Details  , review/enter  the basic travel details.  The Basic\n\n Travel Details listed on the authorization will display on the reimbursement.  Review this\n information for accuracy as some details may have changed.  (An * denotes a required field).\n\n •\n\n •\n\n Enter the  Begin Date  and  End Date  .  Important: The  College requires travelers to\n submit their travel expenses for reimbursement no more than 30 days after the travel\n end date  .

Research, are for students who plan to attend a research conference and need additional financial assistance with travel to present their work. They are distributed to a student’s mentor or home department who must match the amount and then award funds through a travel reimbursement. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year, including summer.\n\n![SCUBA diver underwater making the sign of the wolfpack with their hand](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/10/2021-NC-Scuba-Dive-M-Beeson-cropped-edited.jpg)\n\n## Funding\n\n* Applicants may request up to $200 to partially cover their travel/conference-related expenses.\n  + Amount must be matched by student’s mentor or home department.\n  + Funds are disbursed to student’s mentors or home departments to then be awarded as reimbursements after travel and requirements are fulfilled. *Please note: this means that the student’s home department will be responsible for creating the Travel Authorization and the Travel Reimbursement. The OUR will transfer funds to the department via IDT.*\n* Final amount awarded depends on availability of funds.\n\n## Eligibility\n\n* Must be an NC State-enrolled undergraduate student in good academic standing enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours.\n  + Must having matching funds promised by NC State mentor or home department.\n  + International students must reach out to the Controller’s Office Tax Specialist to confirm eligibility for travel reimbursements and to understand their taxable status.\n* Must be accepted to present original research at a research conference.\n* Previous awardees must have completed the process in good standing, but will receive lower priority over first-time applicants until the new fiscal year begins in July. With the new fiscal year, priority levels will be refreshed.\n\n[![Tarsier on a leaf](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/640px-Tarsius_tarsier_Tandurusa_zoo-credit-Sakurai-Midori-from-Froves-and-Shekelle-2010-e1718916299584.jpg)\n\n### Special Note:\n\nWe offer up to complete coverage of travel, lodging, and registration expenses for the following multidisciplenary undergraduate research conferences through a separate application:\n\nACC Meeting of the Mind\nNCUR\nSNCURCS\nWCUR\n\nLearn More and Apply](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/show-your-work/)\n\n## Program Requirements\n\n* Present the research described in the application at the listed conference.\n* Obtain receipts for expenses being covered by the award.\n  + See FAQs below for a list of allowable expenses for reimbursement and for receipt requirements.\n  + Must submit to mentor or home department for reimbursement.\n* Complete all required paperwork by the deadlines given.\n* Submit a 250-500 word reflection about the experience after returning.\n  + Share what you got out of the experience: knowledge, networking, professional development, new research ideas, etc. *(Optional) share photos of your trip.*\n\n## Deadlines\n\n## Completed Application\n\n3 weeks prior to conference travel\n\n## Reimbursement Paperwork\n\n2 weeks after the end of the conference\n\n## Reflection Assignment\n\n2 weeks after the end of the conference\n\n## Application Process\n\nTo apply, students must fill out the [Travel Award Application-Student Form](https://forms.gle/Q8QX4xHxL292VkQ96) and their mentors must fill out the [Travel Award Application-Mentor Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmuMyMTAPbfPBVlltsLHT6w8atoMosjuGgr7QMWeYE-KkEJA/viewform?usp=header).\n\n**Students will be asked to provide the following:**\n\n* Applicant Information (name, email, ID, phone number, department, college, and anticipated graduation date)\n* Co-presenter Information (name, email, ID, and department)\n* Mentor Information (name and email) + department (for NC State Mentors) *or*institution/company and job title (for non-NC State Mentors)\n* Conference Information (name, date(s), location, and website)\n  + *Applicants will also be asked to provide the name(s) of any additional conferences attended or to be attended this academic year and to explain how their travel was/will be funded.*\n* Response (1 paragraph minimum) to the Following Prompt\n  + *Explain why you wish to attend this meeting, include what you expect to gain from presenting and how presenting will affect your plans for the future (i.e. grad school, career).*\n* Presentation Information (type and title)\n* PDF of Abstract\n  + *Use the file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_Abstract”*\n* PDF of Abstract Acceptance Notification\n  + *Use the file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_Acceptance”*\n* Travel Plans (dates, mode, etc.)\n* Expense Information (estimated total and other sources of funding)\n* For International Travel, a PDF of [International Gateway](https://packabroad.ncsu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&id=3667) Email Confirmation\n  + *Use file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_International Confirmation Email”*\n* For International Students, a PDF of the Controller’s Office Tax Specialist Communication Regarding Eligility for Travel Reimbursements and Tax Requirements\n  + *Use file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_Tax Specialist Communication”*\n\n**Mentors will be asked to confirm/provide the following:**\n\n* Applicant Information (name and email)\n* Mentor Information (name and email) + department (for NC State Mentors) *or*institution/company and job title (for non-NC State Mentors)\n* Response (1 paragraph minimum) to the Following Prompt\n  + Explain the nature of the meeting and why it is appropriate for the applicant to attend.\n\n## FAQs\n\n## What can be reimbursed with travel award funds, per University policy?\n\n**Allowable Expenses:** Conference Registration, Transportation (taxi, Uber, Lyft, train, and airfare), Accommodations (hotels and motels), Meals\\* (excluding any provided by the conference or hotel accommodations-documentation may be needed), Mileage\\* (to and from conference location/city-*only covered if in the student awardee’s vehicle*), Parking (at destination), Tips\\* $5 or Less (for baggage service)\n\n\\*These are the ***only*** expenses which ***do not*** require a receipt for reimbursement.

Note:  AFROTC Scholarships do not cover room and board.\n\n#### Stipend Entitlements\n\nThe annual book stipend is $900 per academic year, and the monthly stipend increases based on an individual’s student status.\n\n* Freshman: $300\n* Sophomore: $350\n* Junior: $450\n* Senior: $500\n\n#### Travel Expenses\n\nAll high school scholarship recipients are authorized to have their travel expenses covered from their home to the Air Force ROTC detachment’s college where the student enrolls. Reimbursement for travel will be received approximately 30 days after the start of school.\n\n#### Take Into Consideration\n\nThree-year scholarship recipients will not begin to receive scholarship stipends or have their tuition and fees payments covered until the beginning of their sophomore year.\n\nFor current Air Force ROTC scholarship requirements and application deadlines and process, visit [afrotc.com/scholarships](https://www.afrotc.com/scholarships/)\n\n## College Student Scholarship Types\n\n#### General Charles McGee Leadership Award (CMLA)\n\nThis in-college scholarship is awarded to certain eligible individuals not already on scholarship who receive an enrollment allocation and thus are selected to commission into the Air or Space Force. It pays $18,000 per year for two years and cannot be applied to graduate studies.\n\n#### In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP)\n\nIf you’re already in college, you can still experience the benefits of joining Air Force ROTC. In addition to detachment-specific scholarship opportunities, freshman and sophomore students may be eligible for the In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP). The program awards scholarships based on merit during two selection phases (fall and spring semesters).\n\nAFROTC offers various capped (up to a specific maximum amount of tuition benefits each year) and uncapped (no fixed limit on the amount of awarded tuition benefits) scholarship types. Scholarship types and amounts will be determined at the time of award for those who receive a scholarship offer.\n\n#### Type 1\n\nOnly available for HSSP applicants. It pays 100 percent tuition and authorized fees at any public or private institution with an Air Force ROTC detachment. Selectees also receive a monthly living expense stipend and an annual book stipend.\n\n#### Type 2\n\nThis is awarded to all cadets selected through the ICSP and pays up to $18,000 per year in college tuition at any public or private institution with an Air Force ROTC detachment. Scholarship payment is further capped at up to $9,000 per semester or up to $6,000 per quarter. Selectees will also receive a monthly living expense stipend and an annual book stipend.\n\n#### **Type 4**\n\nThis is scholarship type pays up to $36,000 a year for tuition and fees to bridge the gap between Type 1 and Type 2 and is available for HSSP and Express ICSP.\n\n#### Housing Benefit\n\nAny scholarship awardee will be allowed to convert their award for a $10K-per-academic-year “housing scholarship” used for on-campus housing. This is for room only; board is not included, and the conversion must begin at the start of the fall academic term if exercised.\n\nFor current Air Force ROTC scholarship requirements and application deadlines and process, visit [afrotc.com/scholarships](https://www.afrotc.com/scholarships/)\n\n[Air Force ROTC\nHome](https://dasa.ncsu.edu/)\n\nWilliam Neal Reynolds Coliseum\n2411 Dunn Ave, RM 135E\nCampus Box 7308\nRaleigh, NC 27695-7308\n\nairforce-rotc@ncsu.edu\n\n919.515.2417\n\n## Google Map Directions\n\n[![google map image](https://airforce.dasa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2023/06/map-to-reynolds-300x164.jpg)](https://goo.gl/maps/DVUB2gZHGxLFKdw68)\n\n* [US Air Force](http://www.af.mil/)\n* [US Space Force](https://www.spaceforce.mil)\n* [Air Force Recruiting](http://www.airforce.com/)\n* [Air Force ROTC](https://www.afrotc.com/)\n* [Holm Center](http://www.airuniversity.af.mil/Holm-Center/)\n* [Website Accessibility](https://accessibility.ncsu.edu/)\n* [Compliments & Complaints](http://dasa.ncsu.edu/about/complaints-compliments/)\n* [Website Feedback](http://dasa.ncsu.edu/website-feedback/)\n* [Freedom of Information Act](http://www.compliance.af.mil/)\n* [Privacy and Security Notice and (FOIA)](https://airforce.dasa.ncsu.edu/privacy-and-security-notice-and-foia/)\n\n## Connect With Us\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ncstateafrotc)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ncstateafrotc595)\n\n© 2025 NC State University.

Please review the following information to gain a better understanding of what you need to do prior to making any travel arrangements.\n\n### **Travel Authorization**\n\nEmployees traveling on University business **must**have written **prior**approval from the department head (or their designee) **before**traveling and in order to qualify for reimbursement of overnight travel costs or meal costs when traveling overnight. Department Heads, or others that authorize travel, must have their travel authorized similarly by their supervisor or their designee.\n\nItems that require specific written prior approval by the department head include:\n\n1. Overnight travel including lodging and meals\n2. Excess lodging rates\n3. Excess meals for out-of-country travel\n4. Business class fare for international overseas flights\n5. Vehicle rental\n6. Use of a private vehicle\n7. Attendants for handicapped employees\n\n**If adding personal travel to a business trip**, the traveler needs to upload documentation as part of the Travel Authorization (TA) that proves the addition of the personal time does not increase the cost of the trip (e.g., flight without extra days vs. flight with extra days).\n\n**If choosing to drive versus fly or visa versa (if the location is close enough to drive)**, the Traveler needs to upload documentation of the cost analysis done to either cap their mileage (e.g., only request up to cost of airline ticket, including airline flights cost as back-up) or if you request more, show the cost analysis done to show driving is more economical (e.g., flight + car rental + parking fee at hotel) – again including the back-up to support those costs).\n\n**\\*\\* REMEMBER\\*\\***\n\nFor insurance/liability purposes, employees should have their travel authorized prior to traveling and always make sure that they can support their travel activities as being for official university business as authorized by the department even for day trips. It is recommended for verification purposes that employees document their communication of the travel plans and the business purpose of day trips with their supervisor or their designee prior to the trip by email, memo, letter, or other departmental forms.\n\n### [Instructions for Creating a Travel Authorization (TA)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYbqQGx38xGNdvmSXbpz_LAzIZu0jrp0tTysIOk5pc0/edit#heading=h.qverom9xsvfu)\n\n*Before traveling please be sure to review the instructions and policies on the [University Controller’s Office website](https://controller.ofa.ncsu.edu/accounts-payable/travel-center/), including how to obtain authorization, travel warnings, trip insurance, trip cancellation or changes, and more.*\n\n[## During the Trip](#ncst-accordion-item-3-3)\n\n**While traveling please be sure to collect receipts for any items you will be requesting reimbursement for. Here is some additional helpful information to keep in mind while traveling:**\n\n### **Transportation**\n\n* **Commercial Airlines:** Transportation by commercial airlines is limited to actual coach fares. Special charges by commercial airlines including baggage fees, seating accommodations within the coach class section, or airport service charges are allowable charges and may be paid/reimbursed as part of air transportation expenses.\n  + Employees traveling internationally on overseas flights may be reimbursed actual business class fare with prior approval of the department head or designee. *(See*[*Section 4.1.1 of the Travel Manual*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYbqQGx38xGNdvmSXbpz_LAzIZu0jrp0tTysIOk5pc0/edit#heading=h.h7bs811i8kld)*for detailed information).*\n* **Ground Transportation:** University travel shall be conducted in the most efficient manner and at the lowest and most reasonable cost to the university.

Students and Faculty****should not****be placing orders outside of Marketplace.**\n\nPlease use the [MAE Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa) for all non-Marketplace purchase requests within the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. For all Facility Work Order Requests please use [MAE Facility Work Order Request Form.](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/eb5055ffd6a24044bef697c44e9403c8)\n\n[Click here if you don’t know what information you need to provide with a purchase request.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6CSp6QfGqYZ5SxIAqlPBi1a0IAD6BTD/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThese forms will be routed to your supervisor and the appropriate contract manager and/or Business Officer/ Department Head for approvals. You will receive an approval confirmation email when the request is fully approved. This will be the PO you will provide to vendors.\n\n* [Senior Design Personal Reimbursement Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5f1e9a01922a433dae3669b363a6a4bb)\n  + This form is only to be used by AE or ME senior design students requesting reimbursement.\n* [Faculty Start Up Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa)\n  + This form should be used to request faculty start-up funds.\n* [Personal Reimbursement](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5f11a2314182454e8dae06c93ac97ec2)\n  + You can either create a new Reimbursement Form or generate one from an existing Purchase Request.\n* **IT Purchases**\n  + For IT Purchase Requests submit the [IT Purchase Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDtZ60R_-xOIJ0vE0C2Xh66iZ61OpZ_bV0qekutMfW0UgcUQ/viewform?usp=dialog). This form is meant for faculty and staff to order IT equipment and should not be used for other purchase requests.\n  + Visit the [IT page](https://mae.ncsu.edu/mymae/information-technologyit/) for more details.\n\n### Purchasing Process- Purchases under 5K\n\n1. Discuss purchases with your supervisor.\n2. Enter the purchase request into the [MAE Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa). You will receive an email that confirms your order has been submitted correctly.\n3. Request is routed to PI for approval.\n4. Request is routed to Funding manager for approval.\n5. You will receive an email when your request is fully approved.\n6. A purchaser will process the order within 24-48 hours of approval, depending on workload.\n7. You will receive the order confirmation and shipping details as soon as they are received from the vendor.\n8. You will receive an email when your package is delivered.\n9. When you pick up your package, check the contents to make sure they are correct and not damaged.\n\n### Purchasing Process- Purchases over 5K\n\n* Orders over $5000 cannot be placed by departmental purchasing and cannot be placed using a departmental purchasing card. They must be placed by the university’s purchasing team.\n* You will submit your request the same as orders under $5000, except you must include a sole source justification.\n* Create and attach a sole source justification explaining why the item you are buying must come from this vendor.\n  + The sole source justification must be on departmental letterhead and must be signed.\n  + In order to meet state of North Carolina requirements a sole source justification needs to:\n    - Give a brief description of the item and its function\n    - Provide an explanation why the product or service requested is the only product or service that can satisfy your requirements and why alternatives are unacceptable.\n\n* If a sole source justification is not provided, university purchasing will submit the order for bidding. This gives other companies an opportunity to offer a better deal on the same order. The order is posted for bids for 10 days. At the end of the 10 day bidding period, university purchasing will send you the best offer so you can verify all is correct and approve the order.\n* Orders over $5000 take longer to process than orders under $5000. The MAE purchasing team member will submit the order to university purchasing within 24-48 hours of when the order is fully approved. University purchasing processes orders in the order they are received (It usually takes 3-4 weeks for procurement to issue a PO).\n* If a sole source justification is provided- it can take around 3-4 weeks from the date submitted for the university purchasing team to process the order with the vendor.\n* If a sole source justification is not provided- It can take around a week from the date submitted for the university purchasing team to submit the order for bidding. Then the 10 days for bids. After the bids close they will contact you for our approval to proceed with the best offer. Then they can create and send the PO to the vendor. It can take 4-5 weeks to complete this process.\n\n### Important Reminders\n\n* Verify email addresses\n* Verify project number\n* Do not underestimate or leave shipping cost blank\n* Make sure you have set the sharing settings to allow anyone with the link to access documents. If we have to request access to your document/spreadsheet this can delay processing.\n* Backorders, Preorders and Lead times:\n  + Look out for out-of-stock items, backordered items, or items with an extended lead time. If the purchasing team goes to place an order and notices one of these they will put the entire order on hold and contact the requester for further instructions. This can delay processing. Note if you are aware of and approve backordered items in the Comment section so we can proceed. If you know the order has an extended lead time, write that in the comments so we know you are aware of the wait.\n* Product options\n  + If there are options for items (color, length, voltage, etc.) be sure to include this in your order request. If it is not provided, we will contact you to confirm. This can delay processing.\n\n### Who to buy from\n\n* MarketPlace:\n  + Why purchase from a Marketplace vendor?\n    - Vendors offer us educational discounts\n    - Most vendors offer us Free shipping\n    - Easier and more lenient returns\n    - [MarketPlace Vendor List](https://materialsmgmt.ofa.ncsu.edu/purchasing/marketplace/)\n* Non-MarketPlace:\n  + We Highly recommend you not use an international vendor, unless absolutely necessary.\n    - There are hidden costs that you may not see (customs and duty taxes).\n    - Shipping is generally slower\n    - Returns are difficult\n    - Less recourse if items arrive damaged or not as described\n    - Take longer to process, especially if the vendor does not have an online ordering system. Time differences, language barriers, payment options, and different international holidays can all delay processing.\n  + If the vendor cannot accept credit cards, and has not done business with NC State before, we will have to add them to the university’s supplier center via payment works before we can place an order with them. Depending on how fast the vendor completes the online registration it can take some time to get them approved as a new vendor\n* NC State has debarred (banned) vendors which we are not allowed to order from [debarred vendor](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/ece-administration/finance/purchasing/helpful-links).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n* What if I want to use a service provided by NC State? For example, Surplus\n  + An order request must be submitted. Once approved, we will provide you with information to give to them.\n* What if I need to add another item(s) to an order that has already been submitted to MAE Purchasing?\n  + It is best to submit a new order request.\n* What if I need to cancel my order?\n  + Please email MAE-purchasing@ncsu.edu asking the order to be canceled.\n* What if packages are expected to be delivered over the weekend or on a holiday?\n  + No deliveries will occur at the University because we are closed. Deliveries will occur the next business day.\n* Can items be shipped to my home?\n  + No, it is against University Policy.\n* Can I pick up an item that was delivered to Main Campus Mailroom due to USPS?\n  + No. The University Main Campus Mailroom receives a large volume of mail/shipments daily.\n* What are packing slips?\n  + A packing slip is a document included in a package that lists the contents of the package.\n* Where can I pick up my shipment?\n  + Most shipments are delivered to EB3 Room 3002, if it is too large to be delivered to room 3002, the front desk person will assist you in locating your shipment. Large shipments for MAE West will be shipped to 3240 Ligon Street.\n\n### Travel Processes: Employee Travel\n\n**Travel Authorizations Must Be Approved 30 days Before the Travel Occurs.**\n\n**Travel Reimbursements Must Be Filed no later than 30 days After the return date from travel.**\n\n*Any travel reimbursement filed 90 past the return date are subject to not being reimbursed (any travel reimbursement filed over 30 days past return date MUST have Department Head signature, as well as an explanation for the late filing).*\n\n#### Travel Checklist\n\n1. Go to the Travel Center in your MyPack Portal and create a Travel Authorization. It is suggested you do this at least 30 days ahead of time so that it has time to be fully approved before your travel. Your supervisor and the funding manager will need to approve the authorization request.\n2. Once your TA (Travel Authorization) has been approved you can make purchases for that trip (flight, hotel bookings, rental car, etc.).\n3. Note: Once your TA is approved you have the option to seek the assistance of an MAE Purchaser to help you with your conference registration. Flights and hotels cannot be purchased by the purchasing team, those will need to purchased by the traveler and filed for reimbursement through the travel reimbursement system.\n   1. MAE can only pay conference registration in advance (via an order request – BUT you must include the TA with the request)  MAE will NOT pay in advance for flight or hotel (these will be reimbursed through travel reimbursement).\n4. Make sure you keep a copy of all receipts for all purchases, except meals.\n   1. Meals are reimbursed on a per diem basis. This means you get a set amount of money reimbursed to you for each meal, regardless of what you actually spent on meals. You do not need to keep meal receipts. You will only be reimbursed for meals not covered by the conference/meeting. If a meal is covered by the conference/meeting it should be excluded from your reimbursement.\n   2. Meals are only allowed when in overnight travel status. They are calculated on travel begin and end time on a per diem basis, so make sure your entered dates are accurate. There are different rates for In-State, Out of State, and Out-of-Country Travel.\n5. Once you return from Travel, go to the Travel Center in your MyPack Portal and create a Travel Reimbursement.\n   1. You will need to scan and upload your receipts to the Reimbursement, except meals. Your supervisor and the funding manager will need to approve the reimbursement request.\n6. Once your TR is fully approved, you will be reimbursed via Direct Deposit.\n\n### Travel Tips\n\n* **Travel Authorizations**\n  + Must be submitted in the Travel Portal or by AP104 at least 30 days in advance of travel. The amounts, unless known at the time before your trip, are estimated such as taxi rides and meals.\n* **Conference Travel**\n  + Always upload an agenda. If meals are included in the registration fee you need to exclude these on your meal calculation section.\n* **Hotel Receipts**\n  + A booking confirmation is not a receipt. A Folio is required from the Hotel which itemizes charges and shows proof of payment.\n  + If sharing rooms with another traveler and you are splitting expenses, have the hotel issue separate Folios. If one traveler pays for both parties, the entire amount will be reimbursed to the payee. Do not have your other party pay you for their half. This complicates the reimbursement process.\n  + Remove any room service or hotel restaurant charges from the lodging total.\n* **3rd party / non-commercial lodging**\n  + An example is Airbnb. This requires pre-approval before departing on your trip. Whoever will pay for the airbnb will need to submit the Third Party Housing request following the instructions in the Travel Authorization page (the Information button beside of the Third Party Lodging check box). Each traveler will need to check the third party housing link and reference each other TA’s in the comments section so they are appropriately linked.\n  + To obtain approval to utilize 3rd party / non-commercial lodging, submit a request for approval prior to incurring expenses or traveling by completing the [Pre-Approval for 3rd Party / Non-Commercial Lodging Usage and Expenses Form](https://controller.ofa.ncsu.edu/pre-approval-for-3rd-party-non-commercial-lodging/). Upon clicking submit, the form is forwarded electronically to the University Controller’s Office for review. The review will begin once the fully completed form with all required documentation is received. Incomplete forms and missing documentation will delay the start of the review. Once the review is complete, the University Controller’s Office will email the outcome to the contact indicated on the pre-approval form. Please allow at least 7 business days for processing within the University Controller’s Office.\n* **Airline Receipts**\n  + Boarding passes are not necessary. Include the flight agenda and proof of purchase. If a flight was changed resulting in an e-credit, include the original flight receipt and the adjusted one.\n* **Personal Travel**\n  + For example, when you have finished a conference and want to take personal time before returning home. Note personal travel days in the notes section and include the actual return flight departure day in your travel end time. You will need to exclude meals during your personal days.\n  + Attach 3 flight comparisons of flights leaving after the conference ended. This can be uploaded to the Travel Authorization before your trip. If it is after the trip, attach 3 comparisons of a future date with the departure day being the day after the conference.\n* **Original Receipts**\n  + Original receipts are required for taxi, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. A credit card transaction detail is not acceptable.\n* **Meals**\n  + Meals are only allowed when in overnight travel status. They are calculated on travel begin and end time on a per diem basis, so make sure your entered dates are accurate. There are different rates for In-State, Out of State, and Out-of-Country Travel.\n  + Do not send receipts for meals purchased.\n\n### Travel Processes: Non-Employee Travel\n\n* [MAE Non-Employee Travel Authorization Form](https://click.smartsheet.com/f/app/C62s4ActLUS1GgXRyaoL_A~~/AARF7xA~/IV6YX1XuQaIN2935uXaLbiJz1hNZ4BS3l7ilkBfw9OGfq73XOoRSa5Z4Q4VSidlA_6da1JH-OeMpKsF338_NqUn-hEf5dwfG1hW-LBrTNs8CrI_ZoWP6sTIzIV-A91TscCxcerjuxsE5PJYKxacX2dIYQlT-qEJ77CZPWJYNr_U~)\n* [MAE Non-Employee Travel Reimbursement Form](https://click.smartsheet.com/f/app/3uV4h0B45bz4D6RPoZy38w~~/AARF7xA~/OIzB4HxE-2JDrPpWr1Unm9GpiV-okxa3BWLuLB_y8LJMsrw6wXQUP9wipRYBB-H52w6VlIZLAe-WZ9RrmcC_EOwz1cL9VR6QJX87p8jMBtx_2w0O07v9TJN7TVvMkB3rhfSnpXutZqSvFYGIi48609oJEJfJevxQbvF8z26rsXY~)\n* [Travel Receipts](https://mae.ncsu.edu/mymae/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/08/travel-receipts.pdf)\n\n**Travel Authorizations Must Be Approved 30 days Before the Travel Occurs.**\n\n**Travel Reimbursements Must Be Filed no later than 30 days After the return date from travel.**\n\n*Any travel reimbursement filed 90 past the return date are subject to not being reimbursed (any travel reimbursement filed over 30 days past return date MUST have Department Head signature, as well as an explanation for the late filing).*\n\n#### Travel Checklist\n\n1.

If applicants are all awarded the maximum amount ($1,500), we will minimum 6 awards.\n* In the spring, the GSA allocates $7,500 for the GSA Award for Conferences. If applicants are all awarded the maximum amount ($1,500), we will minimum 5 awards.\n\n---\n\n## **GSA Travel Assistance Award**\n\n*How many GSA Travel Assistance Awards are awarded each semester?*\n\n* Currently, over 20 GSA Travel Assistance Awards worth $500 each are available per semester. However, this does not guarantee that you will receive the award as they are merit-based, just as the GSA Award for Conferences are.\n\n*Are there any other Travel Awards that I can apply for?*\n\n* Based on the availability, through the applications of GSA Award for Conferences or GSA Travel Assistance award, committee can recommend that you receive either Arthur B. Moss International Grant or Bob & Seuster Sowell Travel Fellowship.\n\n### ***Eligibility***\n\n*I want to apply, but have not received notification on my abstract acceptance, can I still apply?*\n\n* You may still apply if you have not received notification on your abstract status by the application deadline. Notify the VP of Academic Affairs as soon as you receive notice. However, if you win the award, we require that you send us the confirmation within two weeks of the notification of winning the award. You will not receive reimbursement until we have the abstract confirmation.\n\n*Are teaching assistant students or online students eligible to apply?*\n\n* Yes, all fee-paying graduate students in good academic standing (GPA > 3.0) can apply.\n\n### ***Reimbursement***\n\n*Do I need to submit a Travel Authorization (TA)?*\n\n* Yes, our reimbursement process follows NC State policy. NC State provides a guide on how to submit a Travel Authorization.\n\n*How will awardees receive funds?*\n\n* The GSA awards operate on a reimbursement basis. This means the applicant must pay for the conference and then be reimbursed after travel occurs. Reimbursement is handled by the GSA Treasurer, and receipts for conference registration, air travel, and hotel are required.\n\n*Does my department receive the funds?*\n\n* The award is reimbursed to the person who paid (and has receipts) for the conference. If a student paid out-of-pocket, then they will receive the reimbursement. If the department covered expenses, then the department will fill out the reimbursement form and receive the funds.\n\n*What expenses are covered?*\n\n* The travel awards cover expenses directly related to your conference, such as conference registration, hotel, airfare, and food. The travel awards do not cover personal expenses such as entertainment or travel which is not directly related to the conference.\n\n*Can I be reimbursed for a reservation through AirBnB?*\n\n* We follow NC State’s policy on AirBnB, and we typically cannot reimburse for this type of lodging arrangement unless it is pre-approved by the university. We would need this same documentation required by the university (approved) submitted to us in order to reimburse.\n\n*How does reimbursement work if I drive to a conference?*\n\n* On the application, you will input your mileage based on the number of miles driven per day. NC State recently updated their mileage reimbursement process (See Travel Mileage Rage Change Memo) so that for the first 100 miles, you will receive $0.535 per mile with any additional miles over 100 reimbursed at $0.17 per day. There are two sections, one, if you travel less than 100 miles per day and an additional section if you travel more than 100 miles per day. To calculate how much you will be reimbursed, you would enter up to 100 miles per day (indicated by “Include 0-100 miles (per day!)”) in the first entry and everything else in the second entry (indicated by “Include 101+ miles (per day!)”). This means that the first entry can exceed 100 miles (in increments of 100). For example, if you drive to a conference that is 150 miles away, you would input 200 miles in the first entry (100 miles there and 100 miles back) and then 100 miles in the second entry (50 miles there and 50 miles back). This would amount to (200 x $0.535) + (100 x $0.17) = $124.\n\n*Can the travel awards be used to support travel expenses for multiple conferences?*\n\n* Unfortunately, an award can only be used for one conference that is specified at the time of applying. It is non-transferable whether it be to another person or to another conference.\n\n### ***Personal Statement***\n\n*Where can I find the personal statement prompts?*\n\n* The prompts are provided within the application in the personal statement section.\n\n*Does the character count include space?*\n\n* Yes.\n\n### ***Letters of Recommendation and DGP Authorization***\n\n*Where do we submit the letter of recommendation?*\n\n* Letters of recommendation must be submitted by the reference writer. The link is publicly available, and the applicant should review it prior to emailing it to their reference writer. Please remember that submitting or saving the information of reference writers on the application would not automatically send them an email with the link. It is applicant’s responsibility to email them the link.\n\n*Where do we submit the DGP Authorization?*\n\n* DGP Authorizations must be submitted by the DGP. The link is publicly available, and the applicant should review it prior to emailing it to their DGP. Please remember that submitting or saving the information of DGP on the application would not automatically send them an email with the link. It is applicant’s responsibility to email them the link.\n\n*Who can write reference letters?*\n\n* Anyone you feel can provide a better representation of who you are outside of your research.\n\n*Will I receive notification when my letters of recommendation and DGP authorization are submitted?*\n\n* Yes. If you have not received notification that these materials are submitted, you should follow up with your reference writer or DGP to make sure that these are submitted before the deadline. Sometimes reference writer or DGP do not enter correct applicant email on their forms. Please make sure to send them correct information. They will not be accepted after the deadline.\n\n*Is there a limit to how many applications can be submitted by a program?*\n\n* No. However, the GSA reserves the right to limit the number of applications to no more than 5% of the total number of graduate students in the same program based on volume of applications received. In this instance, the DGP will assist in narrowing down the pool of applicants from their respective program based on the highest quality of research. This would happen after all applications have been submitted and evaluated and aids in the selection process.\n\n---\n\n## **Applying to Both Awards**\n\n*Can I apply to both awards?*\n\n* Yes. Since there is only one application form for both awards, indicating that you are applying to ‘both’ on one application will be sufficient.\n* If awarded, you can only receive one award per application cycle, determined by the selection committee. A graduate student can receive one award per academic year (Ex. If you receive either award in the Fall 2017, you cannot receive an award in the Spring 2018 OR if you receive either award in the Spring 2017, you cannot receive an award in the Fall 2017). Additionally, you can only receive each award once per graduate degree.\n\n*Can I receive both awards?*\n\n* Yes. However, a graduate student can receive one award per academic year (Ex. If you receive either award in the Fall, you cannot receive an award in the Spring OR if you receive either award in the Spring, you cannot receive an award in the Fall). Additionally, you can only receive each award once per graduate degree.\n\n*I decided after my DGP authorization and letters of recommendation were submitted for one award that I am going to apply to both? Is this okay?*\n\n* Yes, the applicant needs to update this information on their applications. The DGP and reference writers do not need to submit again.\n\n*If I am applying to both awards, what do my letters of recommendation and DGP Authorization indicate on their form?*\n\n* They will indicate that you are applying to both. This provides evidence that you have notified your reference writers and your DGP that you are applying to both possible funding sources.\n\n*If I am applying to both awards, do I need additional letters of recommendation?*\n\n* No. The application form only requires two letters of recommendations.\n\n---\n\n## **General Questions**\n\n*What are the fall and spring timelines for the applications?*\n\n* The travel dates for future award cycles are changed to traveling within a six-month period after the application deadline as stated below.\n* Fall award cycle\n  + Application Available: July 15\n  + Application Deadline: September 15 at 12:59pm\n  + Travel Dates Covered: August 1 – March 30\n  + Notification Date: November 15\n* Spring award cycle\n  + Application Available: December 15\n  + Application Deadline: February 15 at 12:59pm\n  + Travel Dates Covered: February 1 – September 30\n  + Notification Date: April 15\n\n*What if I have multiple presentations at a conference?*\n\n* You would choose the abstract you deem best represents your research. Additionally, you would indicate that you are doing multiple presentations by clicking “Other” under Presentation Type followed by explaining your situation.\n\n*If we are presenting at a conference as group, can we apply as a group?*\n\n* You would apply individually.\n\n*What happens if I have the application open after the deadline and submit final edits?*\n\n* Any edits that are made on the application are timestamped. If you have access and modify your application after the deadline, it will be disqualified.\n\n*How often are the applications updated?*\n\n* Applications are evaluated and revised after each application cycle. This ensures that there are no unfair questions and also allows us to continuously make sure we are meeting the needs of the students.\n\n*Who will judge my application?*\n\n* Applications are judged by a committee made up of graduate students from the GSA. Each application is reviewed by at least 3 committee members from different departments than the applicant. Award decisions are then made by the committee during scheduled meetings.\n\n*How often are the rubrics updated?*\n\n* Rubrics are evaluated and revised after each application cycle. This ensures that there are no biases as well as allows us to continuously make sure we are meeting the needs of the students.\n\n*What are the selection criteria?*\n\n* Each application is judged according to a rubric designed by the selection committee. The rubric takes all application information into account including applicant GPA, recommendation letters and conference scope. Applicants should take extra care with the personal statement, making sure to answer all questions according to given directions and concisely and clearly.\n\n*What happens if I (accidentally) submit multiple applications?*\n\n* We strongly encourage you to keep the current edit link and make sure you fill the form as much as you can before submitting. Only the most recent submission will be reviewed.\n\n[Graduate Student Association\nHome](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa)\n\n## Campus Map\n\n[![nc state university map](https://cdn.ncsu.edu/brand-assets/campus-map/campus-map-300x160.jpg)](https://maps.ncsu.edu/#/buildings/102)\n\n* [About GSA](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/about/)\n* [Funding Opportunities](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/funding-opportunities/)\n* [Student Resources](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/student-resources/)\n* [GSA News](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/category/news/)\n* [Get Involved](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/get-involved/)\n* [Archive](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/student-resources/archive/)\n\n## Connect With Us\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NCSU.GSA)\n* [X](https://www.twitter.com/NCSU_GSA)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ncsu_gsa)\n\n© 2025 NC State University.

      "content": "Creating a Travel Reimbursement for Non-Employee\n\n Contact:\n\n Humanities and Social Sciences\n Financial Services\n\n Last Revision Date:\n\n 8/22/23\n\n Introduction:\n\n This section provides step by step instructions on processing a travel reimbursement within the\n Travel Center for a Non-Employee as excerpted from the NCSU Travel Center User’s Guide.\n Pre-authorization for Non-Employee travel is required and must be agreed to in advance\n by the traveler and the department head/designee as to services to be provided by the\n traveler and the travel expense commitment made by the department.   Students and\n non-resident aliens  must  use form  AP-104  (Non-Employee  Travel Authorization) for travel\n authorization purposes.  Pre-authorization for all others can be accomplished by a personal\n service contract, email or letter of invitation outlining the service and commitment, and/or by\n using form AP-104.  Non-Employees are subject to the same travel policies as are university\n employees, including statutory subsistence allowances.  The college of Humanities and Social\n Sciences requires travelers to submit their travel expenses for reimbursement no more than 30\n days after the travel end date.  Late justifications should be written by the Department Head, and\n should include preventative measures if travel is more than 30 days late.  NC General Statute\n 138-6(c) requires that all reimbursement requests must be filed for approval within 30 days after\n the travel period for which reimbursement is being requested.\n\n All post travel reimbursement requests are processed through The Travel Center.\n\n Steps – Create a Travel Reimbursement without an Approved Travel Authorization for a\n Non-Employee:\n\n 1.\n\n Log in to  MyPack  portal at  https://mypack.ncsu.edu/  .\n\n 2.\n\n Go to  For Faculty & Staff →  under the  Employee Self  Service  section,  click\n\n .\n\n 3.\n\n Go to New Reimbursements.\n\n 1\n\n\f 5.\n\n Enter the Supplier  ID  for the non-employee.

Complete and/or review the following fields:\n\n (cid:0)  Supervisor ID  – The supervisor listed on the reimbursement  will be supervisor of\n the person that entered the reimbursement.  The approval supervisor can be changed\n to fit business needs. To designate another supervisor, enter the Supervisor’s user ID\n in the Supervisor ID field. If you do not know the supervisor’s user ID, use the\n icon to locate the ID.\n\n 2\n\n\f o   Employee, Student, and US Citizen status will be visible. Please note: Foreign\n\n National visitors should have already been cleared for payment via the\n authorization process.  If not, STOP here and  reference  section on Travel\n Authorization_Non-Employees  of the Travel Manual.\n\n o   Verify the traveler’s address. Use the\n\n icon to look  up additional addresses and\n\n make changes if necessary.\n\n o   The system will display the last four digits of the traveler’s banking information.\n If listed, this is an indicator that the traveler will receive a direct deposit of their\n reimbursement. If it is not listed, the payment will be made via check.\n\n o   If there is a  business need  to process a manual check  for pick-up, check the box\n\n next to  Hold Check for Pickup in the Controller’s  Office  and designate a person to\n pick-up the check within the  Comments field  under  Basic Travel Details  .

Important: The  College requires travelers to\n submit their travel expenses for reimbursement no more than 30 days after the travel\n end date  .  Travel submitted beyond the 30-day college  requirement, requires a late\n memo written by the Department Head.  The memo should include preventative\n measures to avoid reoccurrence and must be uploaded to the TR for Campus\n Approval.\n If the travel reimbursement is submitted more than 60 days past the travel end date,\n the initiator will receive the following system message:\n\n 3\n\n\f After clicking the “OK” button, the Late Entry Justification comment box will\n automatically appear and the traveler is required to document why the travel\n reimbursement is being submitted late.   Completion of this field is required in order\n to submit the travel reimbursement for routing.\n\n •\n\n •\n\n •\n\n Enter  Begin Time  and  End Time  (include travel time  to and from duty station/home,\n less personal stops)\n\n Currency Converter link to access the Oanda  currency conversion\n\n Use the\n website.

Research, are for students who plan to attend a research conference and need additional financial assistance with travel to present their work. They are distributed to a student’s mentor or home department who must match the amount and then award funds through a travel reimbursement. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year, including summer.\n\n![SCUBA diver underwater making the sign of the wolfpack with their hand](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/10/2021-NC-Scuba-Dive-M-Beeson-cropped-edited.jpg)\n\n## Funding\n\n* Applicants may request up to $200 to partially cover their travel/conference-related expenses.\n  + Amount must be matched by student’s mentor or home department.\n  + Funds are disbursed to student’s mentors or home departments to then be awarded as reimbursements after travel and requirements are fulfilled. *Please note: this means that the student’s home department will be responsible for creating the Travel Authorization and the Travel Reimbursement. The OUR will transfer funds to the department via IDT.*\n* Final amount awarded depends on availability of funds.\n\n## Eligibility\n\n* Must be an NC State-enrolled undergraduate student in good academic standing enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours.\n  + Must having matching funds promised by NC State mentor or home department.\n  + International students must reach out to the Controller’s Office Tax Specialist to confirm eligibility for travel reimbursements and to understand their taxable status.\n* Must be accepted to present original research at a research conference.\n* Previous awardees must have completed the process in good standing, but will receive lower priority over first-time applicants until the new fiscal year begins in July. With the new fiscal year, priority levels will be refreshed.\n\n[![Tarsier on a leaf](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/640px-Tarsius_tarsier_Tandurusa_zoo-credit-Sakurai-Midori-from-Froves-and-Shekelle-2010-e1718916299584.jpg)\n\n### Special Note:\n\nWe offer up to complete coverage of travel, lodging, and registration expenses for the following multidisciplenary undergraduate research conferences through a separate application:\n\nACC Meeting of the Mind\nNCUR\nSNCURCS\nWCUR\n\nLearn More and Apply](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/show-your-work/)\n\n## Program Requirements\n\n* Present the research described in the application at the listed conference.\n* Obtain receipts for expenses being covered by the award.\n  + See FAQs below for a list of allowable expenses for reimbursement and for receipt requirements.\n  + Must submit to mentor or home department for reimbursement.\n* Complete all required paperwork by the deadlines given.\n* Submit a 250-500 word reflection about the experience after returning.\n  + Share what you got out of the experience: knowledge, networking, professional development, new research ideas, etc. *(Optional) share photos of your trip.*\n\n## Deadlines\n\n## Completed Application\n\n3 weeks prior to conference travel\n\n## Reimbursement Paperwork\n\n2 weeks after the end of the conference\n\n## Reflection Assignment\n\n2 weeks after the end of the conference\n\n## Application Process\n\nTo apply, students must fill out the [Travel Award Application-Student Form](https://forms.gle/Q8QX4xHxL292VkQ96) and their mentors must fill out the [Travel Award Application-Mentor Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmuMyMTAPbfPBVlltsLHT6w8atoMosjuGgr7QMWeYE-KkEJA/viewform?usp=header).\n\n**Students will be asked to provide the following:**\n\n* Applicant Information (name, email, ID, phone number, department, college, and anticipated graduation date)\n* Co-presenter Information (name, email, ID, and department)\n* Mentor Information (name and email) + department (for NC State Mentors) *or*institution/company and job title (for non-NC State Mentors)\n* Conference Information (name, date(s), location, and website)\n  + *Applicants will also be asked to provide the name(s) of any additional conferences attended or to be attended this academic year and to explain how their travel was/will be funded.*\n* Response (1 paragraph minimum) to the Following Prompt\n  + *Explain why you wish to attend this meeting, include what you expect to gain from presenting and how presenting will affect your plans for the future (i.e. grad school, career).*\n* Presentation Information (type and title)\n* PDF of Abstract\n  + *Use the file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_Abstract”*\n* PDF of Abstract Acceptance Notification\n  + *Use the file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_Acceptance”*\n* Travel Plans (dates, mode, etc.)\n* Expense Information (estimated total and other sources of funding)\n* For International Travel, a PDF of [International Gateway](https://packabroad.ncsu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&id=3667) Email Confirmation\n  + *Use file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_International Confirmation Email”*\n* For International Students, a PDF of the Controller’s Office Tax Specialist Communication Regarding Eligility for Travel Reimbursements and Tax Requirements\n  + *Use file naming format, “Last Name, First Name\\_Tax Specialist Communication”*\n\n**Mentors will be asked to confirm/provide the following:**\n\n* Applicant Information (name and email)\n* Mentor Information (name and email) + department (for NC State Mentors) *or*institution/company and job title (for non-NC State Mentors)\n* Response (1 paragraph minimum) to the Following Prompt\n  + Explain the nature of the meeting and why it is appropriate for the applicant to attend.\n\n## FAQs\n\n## What can be reimbursed with travel award funds, per University policy?\n\n**Allowable Expenses:** Conference Registration, Transportation (taxi, Uber, Lyft, train, and airfare), Accommodations (hotels and motels), Meals\\* (excluding any provided by the conference or hotel accommodations-documentation may be needed), Mileage\\* (to and from conference location/city-*only covered if in the student awardee’s vehicle*), Parking (at destination), Tips\\* $5 or Less (for baggage service)\n\n\\*These are the ***only*** expenses which ***do not*** require a receipt for reimbursement.

Please review the following information to gain a better understanding of what you need to do prior to making any travel arrangements.\n\n### **Travel Authorization**\n\nEmployees traveling on University business **must**have written **prior**approval from the department head (or their designee) **before**traveling and in order to qualify for reimbursement of overnight travel costs or meal costs when traveling overnight. Department Heads, or others that authorize travel, must have their travel authorized similarly by their supervisor or their designee.\n\nItems that require specific written prior approval by the department head include:\n\n1. Overnight travel including lodging and meals\n2. Excess lodging rates\n3. Excess meals for out-of-country travel\n4. Business class fare for international overseas flights\n5. Vehicle rental\n6. Use of a private vehicle\n7. Attendants for handicapped employees\n\n**If adding personal travel to a business trip**, the traveler needs to upload documentation as part of the Travel Authorization (TA) that proves the addition of the personal time does not increase the cost of the trip (e.g., flight without extra days vs. flight with extra days).\n\n**If choosing to drive versus fly or visa versa (if the location is close enough to drive)**, the Traveler needs to upload documentation of the cost analysis done to either cap their mileage (e.g., only request up to cost of airline ticket, including airline flights cost as back-up) or if you request more, show the cost analysis done to show driving is more economical (e.g., flight + car rental + parking fee at hotel) – again including the back-up to support those costs).\n\n**\\*\\* REMEMBER\\*\\***\n\nFor insurance/liability purposes, employees should have their travel authorized prior to traveling and always make sure that they can support their travel activities as being for official university business as authorized by the department even for day trips. It is recommended for verification purposes that employees document their communication of the travel plans and the business purpose of day trips with their supervisor or their designee prior to the trip by email, memo, letter, or other departmental forms.\n\n### [Instructions for Creating a Travel Authorization (TA)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYbqQGx38xGNdvmSXbpz_LAzIZu0jrp0tTysIOk5pc0/edit#heading=h.qverom9xsvfu)\n\n*Before traveling please be sure to review the instructions and policies on the [University Controller’s Office website](https://controller.ofa.ncsu.edu/accounts-payable/travel-center/), including how to obtain authorization, travel warnings, trip insurance, trip cancellation or changes, and more.*\n\n[## During the Trip](#ncst-accordion-item-3-3)\n\n**While traveling please be sure to collect receipts for any items you will be requesting reimbursement for.

Students and Faculty****should not****be placing orders outside of Marketplace.**\n\nPlease use the [MAE Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa) for all non-Marketplace purchase requests within the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. For all Facility Work Order Requests please use [MAE Facility Work Order Request Form.](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/eb5055ffd6a24044bef697c44e9403c8)\n\n[Click here if you don’t know what information you need to provide with a purchase request.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6CSp6QfGqYZ5SxIAqlPBi1a0IAD6BTD/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThese forms will be routed to your supervisor and the appropriate contract manager and/or Business Officer/ Department Head for approvals. You will receive an approval confirmation email when the request is fully approved. This will be the PO you will provide to vendors.\n\n* [Senior Design Personal Reimbursement Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5f1e9a01922a433dae3669b363a6a4bb)\n  + This form is only to be used by AE or ME senior design students requesting reimbursement.\n* [Faculty Start Up Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa)\n  + This form should be used to request faculty start-up funds.\n* [Personal Reimbursement](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5f11a2314182454e8dae06c93ac97ec2)\n  + You can either create a new Reimbursement Form or generate one from an existing Purchase Request.\n* **IT Purchases**\n  + For IT Purchase Requests submit the [IT Purchase Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDtZ60R_-xOIJ0vE0C2Xh66iZ61OpZ_bV0qekutMfW0UgcUQ/viewform?usp=dialog). This form is meant for faculty and staff to order IT equipment and should not be used for other purchase requests.\n  + Visit the [IT page](https://mae.ncsu.edu/mymae/information-technologyit/) for more details.\n\n### Purchasing Process- Purchases under 5K\n\n1. Discuss purchases with your supervisor.\n2. Enter the purchase request into the [MAE Purchase Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/6790664e388d4f61908fb8defe496aaa). You will receive an email that confirms your order has been submitted correctly.\n3. Request is routed to PI for approval.\n4. Request is routed to Funding manager for approval.\n5. You will receive an email when your request is fully approved.\n6. A purchaser will process the order within 24-48 hours of approval, depending on workload.\n7. You will receive the order confirmation and shipping details as soon as they are received from the vendor.\n8. You will receive an email when your package is delivered.\n9. When you pick up your package, check the contents to make sure they are correct and not damaged.\n\n### Purchasing Process- Purchases over 5K\n\n* Orders over $5000 cannot be placed by departmental purchasing and cannot be placed using a departmental purchasing card. They must be placed by the university’s purchasing team.\n* You will submit your request the same as orders under $5000, except you must include a sole source justification.\n* Create and attach a sole source justification explaining why the item you are buying must come from this vendor.\n  + The sole source justification must be on departmental letterhead and must be signed.\n  + In order to meet state of North Carolina requirements a sole source justification needs to:\n    - Give a brief description of the item and its function\n    - Provide an explanation why the product or service requested is the only product or service that can satisfy your requirements and why alternatives are unacceptable.\n\n* If a sole source justification is not provided, university purchasing will submit the order for bidding. This gives other companies an opportunity to offer a better deal on the same order. The order is posted for bids for 10 days. At the end of the 10 day bidding period, university purchasing will send you the best offer so you can verify all is correct and approve the order.\n* Orders over $5000 take longer to process than orders under $5000. The MAE purchasing team member will submit the order to university purchasing within 24-48 hours of when the order is fully approved. University purchasing processes orders in the order they are received (It usually takes 3-4 weeks for procurement to issue a PO).\n* If a sole source justification is provided- it can take around 3-4 weeks from the date submitted for the university purchasing team to process the order with the vendor.\n* If a sole source justification is not provided- It can take around a week from the date submitted for the university purchasing team to submit the order for bidding. Then the 10 days for bids. After the bids close they will contact you for our approval to proceed with the best offer. Then they can create and send the PO to the vendor. It can take 4-5 weeks to complete this process.\n\n### Important Reminders\n\n* Verify email addresses\n* Verify project number\n* Do not underestimate or leave shipping cost blank\n* Make sure you have set the sharing settings to allow anyone with the link to access documents. If we have to request access to your document/spreadsheet this can delay processing.\n* Backorders, Preorders and Lead times:\n  + Look out for out-of-stock items, backordered items, or items with an extended lead time. If the purchasing team goes to place an order and notices one of these they will put the entire order on hold and contact the requester for further instructions. This can delay processing. Note if you are aware of and approve backordered items in the Comment section so we can proceed. If you know the order has an extended lead time, write that in the comments so we know you are aware of the wait.\n* Product options\n  + If there are options for items (color, length, voltage, etc.) be sure to include this in your order request. If it is not provided, we will contact you to confirm. This can delay processing.\n\n### Who to buy from\n\n* MarketPlace:\n  + Why purchase from a Marketplace vendor?\n    - Vendors offer us educational discounts\n    - Most vendors offer us Free shipping\n    - Easier and more lenient returns\n    - [MarketPlace Vendor List](https://materialsmgmt.ofa.ncsu.edu/purchasing/marketplace/)\n* Non-MarketPlace:\n  + We Highly recommend you not use an international vendor, unless absolutely necessary.\n    - There are hidden costs that you may not see (customs and duty taxes).\n    - Shipping is generally slower\n    - Returns are difficult\n    - Less recourse if items arrive damaged or not as described\n    - Take longer to process, especially if the vendor does not have an online ordering system. Time differences, language barriers, payment options, and different international holidays can all delay processing.\n  + If the vendor cannot accept credit cards, and has not done business with NC State before, we will have to add them to the university’s supplier center via payment works before we can place an order with them. Depending on how fast the vendor completes the online registration it can take some time to get them approved as a new vendor\n* NC State has debarred (banned) vendors which we are not allowed to order from [debarred vendor](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/ece-administration/finance/purchasing/helpful-links).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n* What if I want to use a service provided by NC State? For example, Surplus\n  + An order request must be submitted. Once approved, we will provide you with information to give to them.\n* What if I need to add another item(s) to an order that has already been submitted to MAE Purchasing?\n  + It is best to submit a new order request.\n* What if I need to cancel my order?\n  + Please email MAE-purchasing@ncsu.edu asking the order to be canceled.\n* What if packages are expected to be delivered over the weekend or on a holiday?\n  + No deliveries will occur at the University because we are closed. Deliveries will occur the next business day.\n* Can items be shipped to my home?\n  + No, it is against University Policy.\n* Can I pick up an item that was delivered to Main Campus Mailroom due to USPS?\n  + No. The University Main Campus Mailroom receives a large volume of mail/shipments daily.\n* What are packing slips?\n  + A packing slip is a document included in a package that lists the contents of the package.\n* Where can I pick up my shipment?\n  + Most shipments are delivered to EB3 Room 3002, if it is too large to be delivered to room 3002, the front desk person will assist you in locating your shipment. Large shipments for MAE West will be shipped to 3240 Ligon Street.\n\n### Travel Processes: Employee Travel\n\n**Travel Authorizations Must Be Approved 30 days Before the Travel Occurs.**\n\n**Travel Reimbursements Must Be Filed no later than 30 days After the return date from travel.**\n\n*Any travel reimbursement filed 90 past the return date are subject to not being reimbursed (any travel reimbursement filed over 30 days past return date MUST have Department Head signature, as well as an explanation for the late filing).*\n\n#### Travel Checklist\n\n1. Go to the Travel Center in your MyPack Portal and create a Travel Authorization. It is suggested you do this at least 30 days ahead of time so that it has time to be fully approved before your travel. Your supervisor and the funding manager will need to approve the authorization request.\n2. Once your TA (Travel Authorization) has been approved you can make purchases for that trip (flight, hotel bookings, rental car, etc.).\n3. Note: Once your TA is approved you have the option to seek the assistance of an MAE Purchaser to help you with your conference registration. Flights and hotels cannot be purchased by the purchasing team, those will need to purchased by the traveler and filed for reimbursement through the travel reimbursement system.\n   1. MAE can only pay conference registration in advance (via an order request – BUT you must include the TA with the request)  MAE will NOT pay in advance for flight or hotel (these will be reimbursed through travel reimbursement).\n4. Make sure you keep a copy of all receipts for all purchases, except meals.\n   1. Meals are reimbursed on a per diem basis. This means you get a set amount of money reimbursed to you for each meal, regardless of what you actually spent on meals. You do not need to keep meal receipts. You will only be reimbursed for meals not covered by the conference/meeting. If a meal is covered by the conference/meeting it should be excluded from your reimbursement.\n   2. Meals are only allowed when in overnight travel status. They are calculated on travel begin and end time on a per diem basis, so make sure your entered dates are accurate. There are different rates for In-State, Out of State, and Out-of-Country Travel.\n5. Once you return from Travel, go to the Travel Center in your MyPack Portal and create a Travel Reimbursement.\n   1. You will need to scan and upload your receipts to the Reimbursement, except meals. Your supervisor and the funding manager will need to approve the reimbursement request.\n6. Once your TR is fully approved, you will be reimbursed via Direct Deposit.\n\n### Travel Tips\n\n* **Travel Authorizations**\n  + Must be submitted in the Travel Portal or by AP104 at least 30 days in advance of travel. The amounts, unless known at the time before your trip, are estimated such as taxi rides and meals.\n* **Conference Travel**\n  + Always upload an agenda. If meals are included in the registration fee you need to exclude these on your meal calculation section.\n* **Hotel Receipts**\n  + A booking confirmation is not a receipt. A Folio is required from the Hotel which itemizes charges and shows proof of payment.\n  + If sharing rooms with another traveler and you are splitting expenses, have the hotel issue separate Folios. If one traveler pays for both parties, the entire amount will be reimbursed to the payee. Do not have your other party pay you for their half. This complicates the reimbursement process.\n  + Remove any room service or hotel restaurant charges from the lodging total.\n* **3rd party / non-commercial lodging**\n  + An example is Airbnb. This requires pre-approval before departing on your trip. Whoever will pay for the airbnb will need to submit the Third Party Housing request following the instructions in the Travel Authorization page (the Information button beside of the Third Party Lodging check box). Each traveler will need to check the third party housing link and reference each other TA’s in the comments section so they are appropriately linked.\n  + To obtain approval to utilize 3rd party / non-commercial lodging, submit a request for approval prior to incurring expenses or traveling by completing the [Pre-Approval for 3rd Party / Non-Commercial Lodging Usage and Expenses Form](https://controller.ofa.ncsu.edu/pre-approval-for-3rd-party-non-commercial-lodging/). Upon clicking submit, the form is forwarded electronically to the University Controller’s Office for review. The review will begin once the fully completed form with all required documentation is received. Incomplete forms and missing documentation will delay the start of the review. Once the review is complete, the University Controller’s Office will email the outcome to the contact indicated on the pre-approval form. Please allow at least 7 business days for processing within the University Controller’s Office.\n* **Airline Receipts**\n  + Boarding passes are not necessary. Include the flight agenda and proof of purchase. If a flight was changed resulting in an e-credit, include the original flight receipt and the adjusted one.\n* **Personal Travel**\n  + For example, when you have finished a conference and want to take personal time before returning home. Note personal travel days in the notes section and include the actual return flight departure day in your travel end time. You will need to exclude meals during your personal days.\n  + Attach 3 flight comparisons of flights leaving after the conference ended. This can be uploaded to the Travel Authorization before your trip. If it is after the trip, attach 3 comparisons of a future date with the departure day being the day after the conference.\n* **Original Receipts**\n  + Original receipts are required for taxi, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. A credit card transaction detail is not acceptable.\n* **Meals**\n  + Meals are only allowed when in overnight travel status. They are calculated on travel begin and end time on a per diem basis, so make sure your entered dates are accurate. There are different rates for In-State, Out of State, and Out-of-Country Travel.\n  + Do not send receipts for meals purchased.\n\n### Travel Processes: Non-Employee Travel\n\n* [MAE Non-Employee Travel Authorization Form](https://click.smartsheet.com/f/app/C62s4ActLUS1GgXRyaoL_A~~/AARF7xA~/IV6YX1XuQaIN2935uXaLbiJz1hNZ4BS3l7ilkBfw9OGfq73XOoRSa5Z4Q4VSidlA_6da1JH-OeMpKsF338_NqUn-hEf5dwfG1hW-LBrTNs8CrI_ZoWP6sTIzIV-A91TscCxcerjuxsE5PJYKxacX2dIYQlT-qEJ77CZPWJYNr_U~)\n* [MAE Non-Employee Travel Reimbursement Form](https://click.smartsheet.com/f/app/3uV4h0B45bz4D6RPoZy38w~~/AARF7xA~/OIzB4HxE-2JDrPpWr1Unm9GpiV-okxa3BWLuLB_y8LJMsrw6wXQUP9wipRYBB-H52w6VlIZLAe-WZ9RrmcC_EOwz1cL9VR6QJX87p8jMBtx_2w0O07v9TJN7TVvMkB3rhfSnpXutZqSvFYGIi48609oJEJfJevxQbvF8z26rsXY~)\n* [Travel Receipts](https://mae.ncsu.edu/mymae/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/08/travel-receipts.pdf)\n\n**Travel Authorizations Must Be Approved 30 days Before the Travel Occurs.**\n\n**Travel Reimbursements Must Be Filed no later than 30 days After the return date from travel.**\n\n*Any travel reimbursement filed 90 past the return date are subject to not being reimbursed (any travel reimbursement filed over 30 days past return date MUST have Department Head signature, as well as an explanation for the late filing).*\n\n#### Travel Checklist\n\n1.

Examples include a PDF of the webpage for the event, an email invitation, etc. If attending a business meeting, a preliminary agenda is required. |\n| **Airfare Comparisons** | When personal travel is included, three round-trip airfare comparisons are required. Comparisons should reflect business-only travel dates, including a travel day to and from the event. Attach the [Airfare Comparison Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZUdY-rEMZPWtAy98TRUQaqOJWSaoa-puINMKuxCaMk4/copy) with your Travel Authorization. |\n| **Driving vs. Airfare Comparisons** | When claiming mileage for longer trips, the [Travel Comparison Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QwdDTFR8BWBPLeKxGIlIRD8Jfy8TVf9bD7qz8Q_PgyI/copy) should be attached to show that your selected travel method provides cost savings to the university. |\n| **Excess Lodging Comparison** | If the lodging estimate is more than $300/night, documented evidence should be attached to support that the rate claimed is within the prevailing lodging rate for reasonable accommodation. |\n| **Rental Vehicles** | Require approval on the travel authorization.

  "final_answer": "Based on the comprehensive information from NC State University sources, here is how you, as a student, can get reimbursement for your travel expenses:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understand the Type of Travel and Your Status\n\n- **Student Travel Classification:**\n  - If you are traveling **as an employee of the state** (e.g., a graduate assistantship or student worker), your travel expenses are considered official state business and reimbursed accordingly.\n  - If you are a **non-employee student** traveling on official state business (e.g., to present research), you are subject to the same travel policies as university employees.\n  - If you are traveling to **fulfill a course requirement for academic credit**, prior written approval is required.\n  - International students should consult with the Controller’s Office Tax Specialist to confirm eligibility and tax implications.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Obtain Travel Authorization Before Your Trip\n\n- **Travel Authorization (TA) is required prior to travel** to qualify for reimbursement of overnight travel costs or meals.\n- For students (non-employees), you must complete and have approved the **AP104 Non-Employee Travel Authorization form** before travel.\n- The TA must be approved by your department head or designee.\n- For travel involving personal days or driving vs. flying, you must provide documented cost comparisons and justification as part of the TA.\n- Submit your TA at least 30 days before travel to allow time for approvals.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Keep Detailed Documentation During Travel\n\n- Collect **original, itemized receipts** for all expenses you will request reimbursement for, except for meals (which are reimbursed on a per diem basis and do not require receipts).\n- Receipts must show:\n  - Name of the traveler (you)\n  - Date(s) of service or purchase\n  - Amount paid and method of payment\n  - Vendor name and address\n- For mileage reimbursement, keep mileage logs or maps showing routes.\n- For international travel, convert foreign currency expenses to USD using approved currency converters (e.g., Oanda) and save conversion documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Submit Travel Reimbursement (TR) After Your Trip\n\n- After travel, create and submit a **Travel Reimbursement** request through the **Travel Center** in your MyPack Portal or via your department’s designated process.\n- Attach all required receipts and documentation.\n- For non-employees and students, the approved AP104 form must be attached with the reimbursement request.\n- Meals are reimbursed per diem; do not submit meal receipts.\n- Mileage reimbursement follows NC State’s mileage rates and requires documentation.\n- If you used third-party lodging (e.g., Airbnb), pre-approval is required, and reimbursement is only possible if approved in advance.\n- Submit your reimbursement request **within 30 days of the travel end date** to avoid delays or denial. Late submissions require a memo from the Department Head explaining the delay.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Specific Travel Awards and Funding Opportunities for Students\n\n### Graduate Students\n\n- The **Graduate Student Association (GSA)** offers **Travel Awards** and **Travel Assistance Awards** to help reimburse travel expenses related to conference attendance.\n- These awards operate on a **reimbursement basis**: you pay expenses upfront and then submit receipts for reimbursement.\n- Eligible expenses include conference registration, airfare, hotel, meals (per diem), mileage (if driving your own vehicle), parking, and tips within policy limits.\n- You must submit a Travel Authorization (TA) following NC State policy.\n- Reimbursement is made directly to the student who paid the expenses.\n- Applications require abstract acceptance confirmation, letters of recommendation, and DGP authorization.\n- Awards are limited and merit-based.\n\n### Undergraduate Students\n\n- The **Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR)** offers **Travel Awards** for undergraduates presenting original research at conferences.\n- Awards provide up to $200, matched by your mentor or home department.\n- Funds are transferred to your mentor or department, who then reimburse you after travel.\n- Eligible expenses include conference registration, transportation (taxi, Uber, airfare), lodging (hotels/motels), meals (per diem), mileage (if driving your own vehicle), parking, and small tips.\n- Airbnb or third-party accommodations are generally **not reimbursable** unless pre-approved.\n- You must submit the **Travel Award Application** along with mentor confirmation.\n- Reimbursement paperwork and a reflection on the experience are required after travel.\n- Travel awards are reimbursements only; no upfront funds are provided.\n\n---\n\n## 6. General Policies and Guidelines\n\n- **Meals**: Reimbursed only during overnight travel and on a per diem basis; receipts not required.\n- **Lodging**: Must be from commercial lodging with itemized receipts showing proof of payment.\n- **Transportation**: Airfare reimbursed at coach class rates; baggage fees and airport charges are reimbursable.\n- **Mileage**: Mileage reimbursement rates apply; mileage logs/maps required.\n- **Tips**: Reasonable tips are reimbursable within policy limits (e.g., $2 per bag for baggage handlers, $5 for taxi).\n- **Travel Advances**: Generally not available for students; reimbursements are post-travel.\n- **Late Reimbursements**: Must include Department Head memo explaining delay; reimbursements filed more than 90 days late may be denied.\n\n---\n\n## 7. How to Start the Process\n\n- Visit the **NC State Travel Center** website for policies, forms, and instructions:  \n  https://controller.ofa.ncsu.edu/accounts-payable/travel-center/\n- For non-employee student travel, complete and get approval on the **AP104 Non-Employee Travel Authorization form** before travel.\n- Use the **Travel Center in MyPack Portal** to create Travel Authorizations and Travel Reimbursements.\n- For funding support, explore:\n  - Graduate Student Association Travel Awards: https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/funding-opportunities/conference-award/\n  - Office of Undergraduate Research Travel Awards: https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/travel-awards/\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Steps for Student Travel Reimbursement\n\n1. **Before Travel:**\n   - Obtain prior approval and complete Travel Authorization (AP104 for non-employee students).\n   - Submit TA at least 30 days before travel.\n   - Obtain any necessary pre-approvals (e.g., for third-party lodging).\n\n2. **During Travel:**\n   - Collect all required receipts (except meals).\n   - Keep mileage logs if driving.\n   - For international travel, document currency conversions.\n\n3. **After Travel:**\n   - Submit Travel Reimbursement request within 30 days.\n   - Attach all receipts and approved AP104 form.\n   - Submit to your department or through the Travel Center.\n   - If using travel awards, submit reimbursement paperwork to the awarding office or your department.\n\n4. **Receive Reimbursement:**\n   - Reimbursement is typically via direct deposit.\n   - Timing depends on department processing.\n\n---\n\nIf you need detailed instructions or forms, contact your department’s business office or the University Controller’s Office Travel Center. For specific college or department procedures (e.g., CALS, CNR, MAE), check their internal travel resources as they may have additional guidance.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion, to get reimbursement for your travel expenses as a student at NC State University, you must:**\n\n- Obtain prior travel authorization (AP104 form for non-employees/students).\n- Follow university travel policies and collect required documentation.\n- Submit a travel reimbursement request through the Travel Center or your department within 30 days of travel.\n- If applicable, apply for travel awards through GSA (graduate students) or OUR (undergraduates) to help cover costs, noting these awards reimburse after travel with required documentation.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also provide direct links to key forms or resources mentioned above.",
