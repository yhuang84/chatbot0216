ANSWER:
==================================================
Based on the comprehensive information from NC State University sources, here is how you, as a student, can get reimbursement for your travel expenses:

---

## 1. Understand the Type of Travel and Your Status

- **Student Travel Classification:**
  - If you are traveling **as an employee of the state** (e.g., a graduate assistantship or student worker), your travel expenses are considered official state business and reimbursed accordingly.
  - If you are a **non-employee student** traveling on official state business (e.g., to present research), you are subject to the same travel policies as university employees.
  - If you are traveling to **fulfill a course requirement for academic credit**, prior written approval is required.
  - International students should consult with the Controller’s Office Tax Specialist to confirm eligibility and tax implications.

---

## 2. Obtain Travel Authorization Before Your Trip

- **Travel Authorization (TA) is required prior to travel** to qualify for reimbursement of overnight travel costs or meals.
- For students (non-employees), you must complete and have approved the **AP104 Non-Employee Travel Authorization form** before travel.
- The TA must be approved by your department head or designee.
- For travel involving personal days or driving vs. flying, you must provide documented cost comparisons and justification as part of the TA.
- Submit your TA at least 30 days before travel to allow time for approvals.

---

## 3. Keep Detailed Documentation During Travel

- Collect **original, itemized receipts** for all expenses you will request reimbursement for, except for meals (which are reimbursed on a per diem basis and do not require receipts).
- Receipts must show:
  - Name of the traveler (you)
  - Date(s) of service or purchase
  - Amount paid and method of payment
  - Vendor name and address
- For mileage reimbursement, keep mileage logs or maps showing routes.
- For international travel, convert foreign currency expenses to USD using approved currency converters (e.g., Oanda) and save conversion documentation.

---

## 4. Submit Travel Reimbursement (TR) After Your Trip

- After travel, create and submit a **Travel Reimbursement** request through the **Travel Center** in your MyPack Portal or via your department’s designated process.
- Attach all required receipts and documentation.
- For non-employees and students, the approved AP104 form must be attached with the reimbursement request.
- Meals are reimbursed per diem; do not submit meal receipts.
- Mileage reimbursement follows NC State’s mileage rates and requires documentation.
- If you used third-party lodging (e.g., Airbnb), pre-approval is required, and reimbursement is only possible if approved in advance.
- Submit your reimbursement request **within 30 days of the travel end date** to avoid delays or denial. Late submissions require a memo from the Department Head explaining the delay.

## 5. Specific Travel Awards and Funding Opportunities for Students

### Graduate Students

- The **Graduate Student Association (GSA)** offers **Travel Awards** and **Travel Assistance Awards** to help reimburse travel expenses related to conference attendance.
- These awards operate on a **reimbursement basis**: you pay expenses upfront and then submit receipts for reimbursement.
- Eligible expenses include conference registration, airfare, hotel, meals (per diem), mileage (if driving your own vehicle), parking, and tips within policy limits.
- You must submit a Travel Authorization (TA) following NC State policy.
- Reimbursement is made directly to the student who paid the expenses.
- Applications require abstract acceptance confirmation, letters of recommendation, and DGP authorization.
- Awards are limited and merit-based.

### Undergraduate Students

- The **Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR)** offers **Travel Awards** for undergraduates presenting original research at conferences.
- Awards provide up to $200, matched by your mentor or home department.
- Funds are transferred to your mentor or department, who then reimburse you after travel.
- Eligible expenses include conference registration, transportation (taxi, Uber, airfare), lodging (hotels/motels), meals (per diem), mileage (if driving your own vehicle), parking, and small tips.
- Airbnb or third-party accommodations are generally **not reimbursable** unless pre-approved.
- You must submit the **Travel Award Application** along with mentor confirmation.
- Reimbursement paperwork and a reflection on the experience are required after travel.
- Travel awards are reimbursements only; no upfront funds are provided.

## 6. General Policies and Guidelines

- **Transportation**: Airfare reimbursed at coach class rates; baggage fees and airport charges are reimbursable.
